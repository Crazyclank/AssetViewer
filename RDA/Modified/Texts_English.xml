Yet it is I who am tricked; duped of my island by persons unknown! Although it can only be the same persons that came to me one ominous day, masked and embroidered with eldrich symbols. They pressed me towards a sale. But I shut the door hard I tell you, and bid them good-day!</Text>

  <Text ID="13328">Hannah is glad to see your first employees arriving on your island.</Text>
  <Text ID="13329">Build your company town: houses, a market and some streets are the first buildings to construct.</Text>
  <Text ID="13330">Residences, market and streets are found in the construction menu.</Text>
  <Text ID="13331">Your houses need to be build close to the market to have access to it.</Text>
  <Text ID="13332">All buildings need to be linked to the trading post, else no one will access them.</Text>
  <Text ID="13165">Hannah worries about your planks stock.</Text>
  <Text ID="13167">New companies need a lot of infrastructure and buildings for their company town. Construction materials are the corner stone of our company development.</Text>
  <Text ID="13166">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13168">Hannah remarks your new planks industry.</Text>
  <Text ID="13172">Develop a planks production industry.</Text>
  <Text ID="13204">All goods are produced with production buildings. You can find them in your construction menu.</Text>
  <Text ID="13205">You will need a woodcutter who will produce wood for the carpenter to make the planks. Both are required to establish a working production chains.</Text>
  <Text ID="13206">A woodcutter needs access to a carpenter or to a storage. But the carpenter will require the access to a storage. Your trading post is the first storage you have.</Text>
  <Text ID="13355">Hannah reminds you to connect your residences to a marketplace.</Text>
  <Text ID="13356">No one will live in a house if it doesn't have access to a market. </Text>
  <Text ID="13357">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13358">Hannah is satisfied that you finally placed a market for your farmers.</Text>
  <Text ID="13359">Make sure your farmers have access to a marketplace.</Text>
  <Text ID="13360">Streets can be found in the construction menu.</Text>
  <Text ID="13361">Houses will always require an access to a market. Market can be found in the construction menu.</Text>
  <Text ID="13362">You can place streets by drag and drop.</Text>
  <Text ID="13363">Hannah is worried one production building can't deliver its goods.</Text>
  <Text ID="13364">All your production buildings deliver their finished goods to another production buildings, else to a warehouse. If they can't do so, their internal storage gets full and the production stops.</Text>
  <Text ID="13365">Hannah is glad to see your production running efficiently.</Text>
  <Text ID="13366">Build a warehouse close to your production buildings or relocate them near an existing storage.</Text>
  <Text ID="13367">Warehouses are simple storages where all your goods can be delivered. They can be found in the construction menu. But as they are expensive, it's sometimes better to relocate your production buildings around existing warehouses.</Text>
  <Text ID="13369">A production building can produce goods used by another production building. In this case it will deliver the goods directly to the building using it. It's more efficient to place the warehouse close to the production buidlings producing final goods (planks, fish, schnapps...). </Text>
  <Text ID="13368">Warehouses share the same storage: all goods delivered to a warehouse are then accessible from all warehouses of the island.</Text>
  <Text ID="13625">Hannah notices that one of your buildings can't access your Trading Post.</Text>
  <Text ID="13626">Markets and warehouses require a street connection to the trading post, else they can't access to your island storage.</Text>
  <Text ID="13627">Hannah is glad to see your infrastructure up and running.</Text>
  <Text ID="13628">Make sure all markets and warehouses are connected to the trading post.</Text>

  <Text ID="13631">Warehouses share the same storage: all goods delivered to a warehouse are then accessible from all warehouses of the island.</Text>
  <Text ID="13381">Hannah suggests that you keep an eye on your people's demands.</Text>
  <Text ID="13382">The more employees you have, the more demanding they become. If you provide the goods and services they ask for, the houses will welcome more and more employees. But if you don't, they may leave. </Text>
  <Text ID="13383">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13384">Hannah is sure that more farmers will soon join your settlement.</Text>
  <Text ID="13385">Provide fish to your farmers.</Text>
  <Text ID="13386">Fishery can only be built at the coast. The ideal location may be close to the trading post, but it still requires a street connection.</Text>
  <Text ID="13387">Once delivered to a warehouse, goods that are consumed by your people like fish are immediately accessible from the market. Make sure that you have enough stock for your population.</Text>
  <Text ID="13388">The range of your market and the stock your have determines how good the supply will be for a house. Make sure that those two factors are as efficient as possible, else your people may leave.</Text>
  <Text ID="14254">The more employees you have, the more demanding they become. If you provide the goods and services they ask for, the houses will welcome more and more employees. But if you don't, they will leave. </Text>
  <Text ID="13425">Hannah despises the new schnapps demand of your employees.</Text>
  <Text ID="13429">You second advisor Aarhant suggests that you produce schnapps.</Text>
  <Text ID="13434">Hannah is glad that you keep your resources for more serious projects.</Text>
  <Text ID="13435">Aarhant feels alone.</Text>
  <Text ID="13436">Hannah is worried about what you're doing with your company.</Text>
  <Text ID="13437">Aarhant is happy you changed your mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="13415">Aarhant suggests that you start producing schnapps.</Text>
  <Text ID="13416">Hannah and Aarhant will never agree on some topics, but you choosed to follow Aarhant's voice. Your people sometimes desire some recreation goods, that provide happiness and some additional taxes, but the production will cost workforce and resources. Schnapps is the first production chain of such a comfort need.</Text>
  <Text ID="13417">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13418">Aarhant already saw many farmers smiling without any reason.</Text>
  <Text ID="13419">Provide schnapps to your farmers.</Text>
  <Text ID="13420">Schnapps is made out of potatoes. You first need to establish a potato farm, then a distillery.</Text>
  <Text ID="13421">Farms need fields. Once the farm placed, you need to select the building and pick the field option to place the fields along the main building.</Text>
  <Text ID="13422">Comfort needs require some workforce to make it run, but the reward in taxes and happiness is high. Yet, you'll find new ways to provide happiness to your people later on.</Text>
  <Text ID="13447">Hannah is losing her temperance.</Text>
  <Text ID="13448">Farms are useless without fields and enclosures. If you want to grow plants or raise herds, you need to build the fields.</Text>
  <Text ID="13449">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13450">Hannah appreciates the farmland view you developped.</Text>
  <Text ID="13451">Make sure your farmers have some fields to work in.</Text>
  <Text ID="13452">Each farm requires its own fields to produce goods. You can find the construction option by selecting the farm.</Text>
  <Text ID="13453">Each farm has its own optimal area size of agricultural fieds. But you don't have to reach this optimal size to have the building working.</Text>
  <Text ID="13454">Farmfields are very small and can be placed anywhere as long as they stand alongside the farm. Yet pastures don't have to be placed alongside the farm, they just need to be placed in its range.</Text>
  <Text ID="13461">Hannah is obsessed with flames.</Text>
  <Text ID="13462">Hannah is certainly paranoid about fire, but her worries are not always unfounded. So many wooden huts can easily burn, hence it's safer to have a fire station around.</Text>
  <Text ID="13463">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13464">Hannah already feels better.</Text>
  <Text ID="13465">Prepare your settlement against city incidents: a fire station will prevent fires.</Text>
  <Text ID="13466">City institutions, like fire stations, take a bit of time to build. Don't wait for a fire to start to build one, it could escalate quickly.</Text>
  <Text ID="13467">Fire stations reduce the risk of fire in their reach. Also, fire chances increase for heavy factories and when houses are piled on each other.</Text>
  <Text ID="13468">Fire stations also automatically extinguish fires. In case the fire rages, you can select your city institution and deploy extra units to face an inferno.</Text>
  <Text ID="13481">Hannah suggests to improve your housing quality.</Text>
  <Text ID="13482">Your farmers are completely supplied with all they need, and you have enough of them to start upgrading your houses. Better housing quality will attract a new working class in your city.</Text>
  <Text ID="13483">Build a productive planks production chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="13484">Hannah is glad to welcome new employees.</Text>

  <Text ID="16698">Bente has no choice but to set her love for animals aside if she wants her crew to survive an expedition to the poles. Canned food would make for perfect rations.</Text>

  <Text ID="16700">Whalers have docked at Bente's harbour. Grave mistake, for she will protect cetacean life at any cost. She would never think of harming the crew of course...but when they are all ashore...</Text>

  <Text ID="18378">George sent Bente some animals that were mistreated, but it seems like something has happened to them en route.</Text>
  <Text ID="18386">Bente's advisors think it's time for her to marry. They have a Mr. Bingle lined up whom she is at least willing to meet. Sir Archibald would be the obvious person to bring them together at a garden party.  </Text>
  <Text ID="18387">Bente needs a dress to attend a garden party to meet her potential husband, Mr Bingle. Apparently Madame Kahina has a nice selection for formal occasions.</Text>
  <Text ID="18388">It is with regret that Bente agrees, at the request of Sir Archibald and Mr. Bingle, to sever ties with Alonso Graves, to whome she is a good friend. She asks you to deliver him a letter and a parting gift.</Text>

  <Text ID="18419">Finally realising the sequence of events, the captain reluctantly agrees to lead you to the flotsam he to recover what he believes to be a cursed artefact.</Text>
  <Text ID="18420">Recovering the artefact does indeed seem to have cursed your ship, and you never found those missing crewmen...but Bente won't believe in any of that, so you better bring her the mummy.</Text>
  <Text ID="18421">The mummy you gave to Bente put in her museum is seemingly responsible for an epidemic of disease in her city. Bente is understandably keen to have the emergency medical supplies Isabel Sarmento has on offer.</Text>
  <Text ID="3144">My assorted pets have such a healthy appetite, they go beserk for boiled potatoes! I really can't keep up with them! Please bring me as many as you can!</Text>

  <Text ID="3582">I cannot risk building steelworks when this island is home to the Ebony Jewelwing, soot would smudge their delicate wings. Perhaps I could buy beams from you instead?</Text>
  <Text ID="3676">I love visiting the orphans, but it breaks my heart... They are children, they should be at play and scoffing sweets! I'd like to give them a treat, could I sneak some from your pantry?</Text>
  <Text ID="3675">You should have seen their innocent, hungry eyes... I just had to give them all the bread we had! It didn't even occur to me that my people need it too...</Text>
  <Text ID="3856">I need new sails before I can set out! The old ones... Well, all those poor people were out in the cold and I had to think quickly!</Text>
  <Text ID="3857">I normally prefer to live on nuts and fruits, but the captain is right, we can't venture out on a polar expedition without plenty of fatty food. Do you happen to have any canned food?</Text>
  <Text ID="3858">I cannot believe I have been wearing leather boots when they could have been made of caoutchouc all along! If you were able to bring me some, you might help prevent the needless loss of animal lives...</Text>
  <Text ID="3163">I cannot look away from the red trail whalers leave in their wake. Quickly! Sink their ship while I entertain the crew at my harbour!</Text>
  <Text ID="3160">My expedition crashed during a storm! The crew saved their own lives, but couldn't take the hyacinth macaws with them. Please, please, save them before it's too late!</Text>
  <Text ID="3181">What a terrible tragedy! A visitor ship has capsized on its course! We cannot stand idle, we must help the passengers!</Text>
  <Text ID="3842">Poor sailors' superstitions drove them to throw my precious relics overboard. Please retrieve the lost cargo before it's lost forever! I can take any silly curse they bear.</Text>
  <Text ID="4081">Our oceans are becoming more and more cluttered by the day! I fear for the marine life... Clean up with me and people will surely begin to follow our example!</Text>
  <Text ID="3894">I know my advisors only want the best for me, but sometimes they can be so... bothersome. They insist I shouldn't go alone on my expeditions. Please would you sail with me a little just to set their minds at ease?</Text>
  <Text ID="4097">Cousin Alva had to cut her visit short, apparently the poor thing is allergic to my pets... You should have seen her face when she opened the door to their welcome chorus! Perhaps you could see her home for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="18306">My museum is coming along rather nicely, but as with anything can always be improved! If you can spare the time, I would like to hang pictures of my artefacts around the gallery, and need a photographer...</Text>
  <Text ID="18338">I know why you haven't built a zoo; you're worried it would be cruel. I felt the same, until I realised my zoo could protect endangered species from extinction! Not to mention educating people of all walks of life about the joy of the wilderness!</Text>
  <Text ID="18339">Why don't you build a museum? I'd have so many fascinating artefacts to give you if you did! It's terrible really, the display cabinets are so stuffed, I'm forced to keep most of my collection in a dusty undercroft...</Text>
  <Text ID="18343">I will not make a habit of interfering with nature, but I have heard the winter is like to be particularly hard this year. As such, I would prefer if the animals on my island were safe in the comfort of my zoo until the weather improves. Please say you are able to help?</Text>
  <Text ID="18345">Madame Kahina recently imported some exotic animals. I have already decided I shall be the one to take care of them. They will need a great deal of love since they're so far from home. Sadly all my ships are on expeditions, so I wondered if you might collect them for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="18352">Here to collect Bente's animals? But you're three days early— they're still in their crates. If you still want them now, you'll have to find them yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="18359">Everyone needs love in their lives, and animals give it freely! Please take care of this dear little cat. Since he grew, I find I don't quite have so much time for him anymore - he is rather big these days! But I'm sure he will make you very happy!</Text>
  <Text ID="18360">I'm back! I think that might just have been my best expedition yet. We would have been completely lost without the local guide, but instead we saw emerald forest weighed down with serpents, a funny sandy thingy where I sadly lost a few men, and in the end we found an enormous treasure! Here you go, you can have it.</Text>
  <Text ID="18362">A lack of material wealth should not hold us back from doing great deeds! I want to donate a little to help keep you on your feet. Sometimes when we run a little short of funds, we worry about relying too much on others. All I intend with this gift is to anticipate that sort of awkwardness in the future. </Text>

  <Text ID="18391">My advisors always remind me how indecent it is for a young, wealthy lady like me to remain single. They have found a perfect suitor in Mr Bingle apparently, a man I know nothing about. I suppose I should at least meet him. Perhaps Sir Archibald might introduce us?</Text>
  <Text ID="18392">"Mr . Bingle is a correct man who enjoys the hunt, and owns a textile industry". Is it awful to say he doesn't sound too much fun? Well perhaps I shouldn't judge yet. If I'm to meet him at Sir Archibald's garden party, I'll need some dresses from the Emporium Exotique. </Text>
  <Text ID="18393">I'm afraid you have arrived just as Mr. Bingle has left. He said nice things about my dresses, but not the company I keep. I am not to meet with Alonso any more, for instance. *sobs*. But as Sir Archibald says, it is probably for my own good. Anyway I must go, or I shall be late for the garden party...</Text>
  <Text ID="18394">I keep hearing about Mr. Bingle. It makes me excited to meet Mr. Bingle. BRING HIM TO ME. Hehe. Ahh poor Bente, all these people around her, telling her what to do. She's just like those birds in those cages, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="18395">It's funny. Mr. Bingle confessed to me that he has no interest in Bente, only her pigs. See for yourself, he's rolling out there in the mud right now. I'm sure she'd love to see a photograph?</Text>
  <Text ID="18396">Our dear child is ready for marriage? And to Mr. Bingle of all people? Well please do give her this letter; an invitation to our little garden party, at which said Mr. Bingle will also be present.</Text>
  <Text ID="18397">Meet Graves? Fine!  if he want to meet, w-w-why not. If he thinks this will scare me away from Miss. Jorgensen, he's very much mistaken. </Text>
  <Text ID="18398">Oh this photograph is horrid! Did you take it? I mean I adore animals, but not like this! How shall I forgive myself for almost breaking ties with Alonso? He proves once more to be, the only *very* close friend I have.</Text>
  <Text ID="18402">Beryl seems to have done wonderful work teaching these street children good manners. I am sure that the Queen would be delighted to have them stay at the palace for a short time— it could help fulfil some of the promises to help the poor she has made of late.</Text>
  <Text ID="18403">Sir Archibald didn't grimace too heavily as he announced the Queen had agreed to let the street children stay over at High Clarence Hall. Can you make sure they have a lovely, safe trip? I promised Beryl I'd take good care of them, you see.</Text>
  <Text ID="18404">I have written to Sir Archibald to apologise for the behaviour of the street children at the palace. Please could you deliver it? If Archie asks, tell him Beryl has agreed to pay any damages she can, though she did say that she isn't a woman of great family wealth, and if it is very expensive it may be beyond her.</Text>
  <Text ID="18405">Oh Bente, you poor dear soul! Those children weren't merely a menace, they were a highly-organised gang of thieves! There's not a bit of silver cutlery left in all of High Clarence Hall!  </Text>
  <Text ID="18414">Take these to Bente, </Text>
  <Text ID="18415">"Oh dear, this quote on quote "baron" seems to have a fever! How do I tell him this in the right way...? Don't worry I will make sure he get's the message!"</Text>
  <Text ID="18416">Flowers? Thanks! I guess... (not happy about them) What about this ring? You want me to pay for that? It's not worth that much... but since it's you!  </Text>
  <Text ID="18422">The expedition to the ruins of the sun worshippers should have been back weeks ago! I do remember they were worried about a mysterious curse...I wonder if you might find them and help them?</Text>
  <Text ID="18423">Ahoy! Our heartiest thanks for your help. The last we remember we were aboard our ship, carrying the sarcophagus we found in the cave of the sun worshippers. Then everything went black. I wonder if there are any clues nearby? I'll bet it was the curse...</Text>
  <Text ID="18424">I recall it all now! As we left the sunlit reef, the whale seemed angry and shook the sea with its tail. Our helmsman must have panicked, at that is when we wrecked! But that doesn't explain where the artefact or missing crew of the little boat went...</Text>
  <Text ID="18425">I warned you about the curse! The artefact, it must be destroyed! Bente won't listen to an old pike like me, she'll put it on display, god forbid! For all our sakes destroy it and end this blight! </Text>
  <Text ID="18426">Oh dear me! No sooner was the mummy exhibit opened to the public, than a wave of disease seem to grip my lovely happy city! Please you must help. Miss Sarmento has promised to find me some emergency supplies!</Text>
  <Text ID="18427">Now I remember! It was our helmsman! He even seemed on edge the moment we departed the caves. No sooner had we left port than he steered us into a reef! </Text>
  <Text ID="18428">Some made a dive to recover our navigation equipment... but when we winched them back up, all we found were severed cables! ...it's the curse I tell yer!</Text>
  <Text ID="18429">This monster! That explains the dreadful eerie noise we heard through the darkness, but doesn't explain on its own how we came to be wrecked here.</Text>
  <Text ID="18441">A curse? Oh how silly! Well, I'm very glad neither of us believe in all that. Really, it isn't very fair on those ancient civilisations to always assume their legacies are nothing more than traps and curses. I shall immediately place this wonderful artefact on display for all to see!</Text>
  <Text ID="18445">Thank you for saving my people! I don't know how I ever shall thank you. Curse or coincidence, I promise to be a little more careful in the future. The lives of the living are worth more than anything else. Please, take this vile mummy with you, I don't want to see it ever again!</Text>
  <Text ID="21736">Look for the wild animals on the mountains of Bente's main island.</Text>
  <Text ID="16430">I was elated with your western method of preserving edibles in metal boxes, but I cannot help but taste the tang of brass in the ones we produce... Is there a secret to it that is lost on me? I desire to savour the difference in your canned food.</Text>
  <Text ID="16431">I am in awe of this horseless carriage. I understand it uses steam to move but... I do not comprehend how exactly it is done! I need to look at it more closely. Will you quench my curiosity?</Text>
  <Text ID="16432">Where I come from, lacquerware is an exquisite art passed on for generation. I am utterly unfamiliar to this wood veneer of the other New World, but I would love to experiment with this foreign material. Would you be able to provide it?</Text>
  <Text ID="17984">Oh, sweet explotions of golden orbs in my mouth! And I learned you have alchemists that extract the nectar and turn it into an enchanting beverage! May I be granted a taste?</Text>
  <Text ID="16433">The brutes I sent to retrieve my last shipment from Madame Kahina's harbour brought nothing but shattered porcelain... Will you be the steady hand to bring me a memento of my childhood...?</Text>
  <Text ID="16434">Friend, did you notice the terrible storm? My father sent precious presents to ease my homesickness, but I'm afraid they might have been torn from their course in the raging winds... </Text>
  <Text ID="16435">Dare I dream my words will ever reach the Queen's honourable ears...? You are in good terms with her Sir Archibald, are you not? Could you bring my poems to him and maybe spare a kind word...?</Text>
  <Text ID="17986">One of the things I miss the most is taking long walks through the imperial gardens. I have been looking for curious and beautiful flora to garnish my residence grounds, and heard Kahina has the seeds to grow pristine, cloud-like flowers.</Text>
  <Text ID="17988">Oh, no... Mother sends ships with visits... But I am sure their true purpose is much darker than that. Please, just... Bring them here discreetly so I can dispatch them before they embarrass me.</Text>
  <Text ID="17989">Sir Archibald sent me a note to thank me for the cookies, but I did not send any! It must have been my mother... I know her, there is no way this gift has kind intentions. Go there and make the cookies vanish before someone cracks them open.</Text>
  <Text ID="17990">Oh, the delicate perfume of brewing tea, I miss it so much it hurts to remember. There isn't a day I don't regret forgetting my favourite kettle back home. I know Beryl too is an avid tea-drinker. Maybe she has a fine kettle to spare for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="17994">I just received a report on your trade history... But I did not order it, I swear! It must have been one of my mother's uncalled-for 'favours'. The spies must roam around your harbour. I deeply apologise in the name of my family!</Text>
  <Text ID="17995">A beautiful flower that grows in the mountains has been haunting my dreams lately. I know I will not stop thinking about it until I can have some for my flower arrangements...</Text>
  <Text ID="16454">Wind-swollen sails are such an inspiring image, are they not? I would like to capture the words of homecoming they whisper in the wind, but I cannot see the docks from my study...</Text>
  <Text ID="16455">I remember the dolphins passing by our vessel when I first sailed to these lands, lifting every shadow of fear from my heart. Had I but an image of them to help me capture these emotions in a poem...</Text>
  <Text ID="16456">I envy the wisdom of elephants in these troubled times. Could I capture their mighty essence in ink and paper...? I wonder maybe if a had a picture...</Text>
  <Text ID="16457">My father has asked me to write a report about the wonders of the western railway system and the oil transportation infrastructure, but I am at a loss of words at its technological wonders. Could you take a picture of your oil harbour to ilustrate my report?</Text>
  <Text ID="16517">I do not recognise my father's kindness in these words, but this request for images of Sir Archibald's headquarters does bear his seal... Do you keep your camera still?</Text>
  <Text ID="17998">I can't stop thinking of our Palace garden and the animals inside. They were so beautiful. Oh, and the dolphins! This makes me homesick. If you manage to bring a dolphin in your zoo, would you mind sending me a picture of it?</Text>
  <Text ID="16436">Poem about sails</Text>
  <Text ID="16437">Poem about dolphins</Text>
  <Text ID="16438">Poem about Elephants</Text>
  <Text ID="16440">Yesterday night I realised I never properly expressed my gratitude for your friendship. This token brought me many visions of home, I hope it now serves to remind you of me.</Text>
  <Text ID="16445">My sister is coming to visit! She wanted to contemplate all the marvels I wrote about with her own eyes. I need to prepare for her arrival, will you escort her safely into my longing arms?</Text>
  <Text ID="16446">I can never repay you for delivering my sister unscathed back to me. She is determined to experience every wonder hidden in this region. I told her many perils lurk beneath the surface, but she feels safe with you...</Text>
  <Text ID="16447">No... My sister has been taken! I... never should have entrusted you with her precious life... I beseech you, help me mend my reckless actions. This is all the gold I own, exchange it for my sister's freedom and bring her back to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="16448">Oh, is that all you have...? In that case, terribly sorry, but we do have a much higher bidder on this little princess' life.</Text>
  <Text ID="16462">My family is forever in your debt, dear friend. My sister will remember the beauty of your home with a sweet smile thanks to your kindness. She gave me this token for you, please accept it.</Text>
  <Text ID="16460">No, mei-mei! It... it cannot be... She only wanted to see her big sister's world... I will never be able to look at my father's face again... Our family is forever broken, thanks to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="16461">I... I am at a loss of words. You do not understand how much you have done for us, for my family. I owe my sister's life to your selfless actions. The Emperor is forever in your debt, dear friend. I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="16449">Father wrote. A close friend of the family set sail to deliver an important present to me... I am afraid this matter requires maximum discretion. Your ships will raise no suspicion, were you so kind as to retrieve it for me...</Text>
  <Text ID="16450">Oh, no, how could this happen...!? The gift, it was stolen from your Queen! My mother's counselor prepared a gift to appease her if we can send it through Sir Archibald, but I dare not venture there myself...</Text>
  <Text ID="16451">Friend! I swear I know not what my mother had me send the Queen, but she stormed here demanding I vow allegiance to her! I will be forever despised in my country, but I have no other option, I must do this for my father...</Text>
  <Text ID="16453">Father comforted my doubtful heart, but mother... She has sent imperial warships to clean the stain I put on our family's name! Her shadow already looms on the horizon... Aid me, friend!</Text>
  <Text ID="16463">Is this what the Princess Qing would like me to hand the Queen on her behalf? Oh, dear... Very well, I will make sure she receives it. Let us all brace ourselves...</Text>
  <Text ID="16467">It is over... It was no doubt the Empress' hand that steered this unfortunate chain of events in an attempt to tarnish father's reputation. I still cannot believe I stood up against her... You truly inspire endless courage, friend. </Text>
  <Text ID="16468">My mother got what she wanted, the Queen is weaken but I am seen here as a traitor, a paria. I am worthless.</Text>
  <Text ID="18004">I know it was Father's wish to come to the Old World himself, but his obligations never allow him to leave his distinguished seat for long enough. I want to send him a piece of this land. The vessel, too, must represent the best of your culture. Do you have any suggestions?</Text>
  <Text ID="18005">The ways it sways in the waves so majestically, Father deserves nothing less! I will command my shipyard to start its construction at once. I know you want to help, can you bring us the materials?</Text>
  <Text ID="18006">Nothing more beautiful ever sailed away from my shipyard. It's the perfect wrapping, but we still lack the gift. I already have some ideas, what would you suggest?</Text>
  <Text ID="18007">Friend! What a magnificent treasure we have put together. Only one more thing remains. A masterpiece from the past, something that truly represents the history of the West. Madame Kahina has a good eye for such treasures.</Text>
  <Text ID="18008">Oh, a present as grand as the land that inspired it and as preeminent as the man that shall receive it. It is ready, shall we gently guide this treasure home?</Text>
  <Text ID="18014">Normally I do not participate of the excitement of expeditions, but for once, they brought a treasure that intrigued me: a tablet written in a forgotten language. I presume Madame Kahina speaks every language, new or ancient...</Text>
  <Text ID="18015">Oh! According to Madame Kahina's translation, the writing on the map points to a place in the middle of the sea. I need to know what lies under the surface! Maybe there's someone who knows the depths of the ocean on your island...?</Text>
  <Text ID="18016">Oh! This person does seem most capable of finding out what it is that the tablet speaks of. I will mark the place on your map, let's see what you discover.</Text>
  <Text ID="18017">I wouldn't believe it if I didn't have them in my hands... Ancient scrolls, sealed under water for centuries! I will ask Madame Kahina to study them and produce translations, I cannot wait to read these forgotten words! In the meantime, you can have the originals, for all your efforts.</Text>
  <Text ID="19829">Indeed, I know this language: it is the one of the ancient Aegeans. I will write a translation for the Princess. Free of charge, I do enjoy these tasks.</Text>
  <Text ID="18026">Our New Year is fast approaching! I would love to commemorate this passing of the year with something that represents both the fragility of time and the technological advances of the era. Have you got something in mind?</Text>
  <Text ID="18027">How could you!? Clocks are terrible luck, especially if given as a gift for the New Year! I guess as a foreigner you cannot be blamed... I know what you can do, I need some fine cloth to decorate the streets, can you provide that?</Text>
  <Text ID="18028">Oh, dear. How could you bring me white cloth!? This is a festival, not a funeral! My... Maybe some sweet refreshments, then? I don't see how you could go wrong with that...</Text>
  <Text ID="18029">Grapes! What a pleasant surprise! This time you hit the nail right on its head, for they symbolise abundance and prosperity. Thank you for all your help and efforts, now the New Year festival may begin!</Text>
  <Text ID="18000">At first I could not see past my heartbroken fog, but now that beauty has lifted the clouds from my eyes, I can recognise wonders I could have never dream of. If only more travellers from my homeland would feel welcome and dare cast anchor here...</Text>
  <Text ID="18001">The greatest gift I could grant you, friend, is the peace and tranquility of listening to the soft tinkling of water running from a nice pavilion. Please try and let me know what you think!</Text>
  <Text ID="16388">Princess Qing is doing her best to mimic the western way of preserving food in cans, but she believes she is not doing something right, for she perceives a metallic taste in the ones her company produces. She has asked you to bring her some of yours in an attempt to figure out what she is doing wrong.</Text>
  <Text ID="16389">The Princess is terribly curios about the steam carriage. She would like to know more about how it works and has asked you to deliver some to her.</Text>
  <Text ID="16390">The Princess would like to try using wood veneer to recreate the lacquered boxes from her home, she has asked you to provide it for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="17985">The Princess loves grapes, they are one of her most relished pleasures. She has heard of a special beverage crafted from their juice and cannot wait to taste it.</Text>
  <Text ID="16391">Princess Qing's best tradeship has already ruined a perfect shipment of porcelain from Madame Kahina's harbour. This time, she has asked you to retrieve it for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="16392">Qing's father sent her a ship with presents from home, but they never arrived. She has asked you to keep an eye out for them and retrieve whatever you find.</Text>
  <Text ID="16393">Princess Qing has been working on her poems and wishes to have them read at the Queen's court. She has asked you to bring her manuscript to Sir Archibald and endorse her a little.</Text>
  <Text ID="17987">The Princess longs to have a beautiful garden like the ones she had back home. She has heard of a beautiful flower that will fill her grounds with fluffy clouds. She would love it if you would get the seeds from Madame Kahina for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="17991">The Empress has sent her daughter a visit from home, but Qing is certain they do not mean well. She would like you to take them to her harbour with the utmost discretion.</Text>
  <Text ID="17992">The Princess is worried that the cookies Sir Archibald received might be a less than kind present from the Empress and has asked you to smuggle them out of High Clarence Hall before tragedy strikes.</Text>
  <Text ID="17993">The Princess misses her tea moment dearly, but she forgot her kettle back home. Beryl too loves tea, so she figured she might have a spare kettle to lend her.</Text>
  <Text ID="17996">The Princess has alerted you that her mother sent spies to gather information about your trade partners. They should be around your harbour area.</Text>
  <Text ID="17997">The Princess' dreams have been haunted by a beautiful flower that only grows up in the mountains. She wants to have some for her flower arrangements, but they are out of her reach.</Text>
  <Text ID="16394">The Princess is trying to write a poem about sails in the wind, but she is finding it hard to capture the image without looking at them. She needs you to take a picture she can keep by her desk to find inspiration.</Text>
  <Text ID="16398">Princess Qing remembers the hope and joy dolphins brought to her heart when she sailed for the Old World. She would like to write a poem about it, but she needs to remember the sight of them with a picture.</Text>
  <Text ID="16399">The Princess needs help with her next poem. Her source of inspiration, elephants, lay far away from her reach, but you can help her if you take a picture of one.</Text>
  <Text ID="16400">It seems like Emperor Qing is very interested in the railway system. The Princess has been tasked to write a report about it, but she has asked you to help her describe it with a picture of your oil harbour.</Text>
  <Text ID="16518">Qing has been tasked to deliver a picture of Sir Archibald's island. She has asked you to take it for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="17999">Take photo of a Dolphin for Qing</Text>
  <Text ID="16401">The Princess deeply relishes your friendship. She would like to give you a little memento from the East so that you can remember her.</Text>
  <Text ID="16402">The Princess Qing's sister is paying her a visit and needs to be safely escorted to Qing's island while she's busy preparing everything for her arrival.</Text>
  <Text ID="16405">Qing's little sister has reached her destination safely thanks to you, and now she feels it is safe for her to visit every corner of the region as long as your warships come along.</Text>
  <Text ID="16403">Qing's sister is held prisoner by the mysterious attackers. She has asked you to deliver the ransom in gold and get her sister safe back to her. </Text>
  <Text ID="16404">Qing's sister's kidnappers have refused to release her. There is only one way left to break her free...</Text>
  <Text ID="16406">The Princess has received a letter from the Emperor telling her that a friend of the family was going to bring her a precious item. She has reasons to believe the situation demands discretion, and has asked you to retrieve it for her instead.</Text>
  <Text ID="16407">The gift Qing asked you to bring her was a treasured belonging of the Queen! The Princess has asked you to deliver it back to Sir Archibald along with a present, as she doesn't dare to go there herself.</Text>
  <Text ID="16408">Qing was set up and now the Queen demands that she pledges allegiance to her. She has no choice, even if bending the knee is against the Empress wishes, it is what she must do for her father, the Emperor.</Text>
  <Text ID="16410">The Empress was not happy to hear her daughter bent the knee before a western ruler and has sent a fleet to attack her! Qing has asked you to back her up in battle.</Text>
  <Text ID="18009">Princess Qing knows her father would love to leave his duties behind and travel the world. Unfortunately, the Emperor cannot afford to do that, so she wants to send him a piece of the Old World, starting with a classical ship. Take a picture of a suitable one.</Text>
  <Text ID="18010">The Princess loves your suggestion to build a ship of the line and has begun preparations at once, but she needs you to help her gather the materials.</Text>
  <Text ID="18011">The ship is ready to sail for the East, but first it needs to be filled with presents that represent the Old World. Qing looks to you for suggestions.</Text>
  <Text ID="18012">The Princess is elated at the gift you are helping her put together for her father, but it still requires one more thing: a treasure from the past. She would like you to go to Madame Kahina to look for something that's fit for the purpose.</Text>
  <Text ID="18013">Qing's present for her father is finally ready to leave port. The Princess has asked you to escort it safely on its way.</Text>
  <Text ID="18018">Princess Qing's expedition brought back an enigmatic tablet written in an old language. She would like to know more about it, Madame Kahina should be able to tell you more.</Text>
  <Text ID="18019">The tablet found by Princess Qing's expedition seems to mark a place in the middle of the ocean. She would like you to ask around your harbour and see if you can find someone who can help you.</Text>
  <Text ID="18020">You have found a diver that will be able to search the ocean for whatever lies underwater. The Princess has marked the spot on your map, go and bring her what you find.</Text>
  <Text ID="18030">The Princess is undergoing preparations for the New Year celebrations. She would like to have something that represents technology and time.</Text>
  <Text ID="18031">Your last gift for Qing was not at all appropriate. Instead, she has asked you to deliver cloth to decorate for the New Years festival.</Text>
  <Text ID="18032">White cloth is a terrible symbol for Princess Qing, You might get luckier with something to eat, something small and sweet, like a coveted fruit.</Text>
  <Text ID="18002">Now that the Princess Qing's homesickness has lifted a little, she is starting to really like the Old World. She wishes you would build a new public mooring to welcome more visitors from her homeland.</Text>
  <Text ID="18003">The Princess has recommended you to build a gazebo by the river to experience the peace and tranquility she was so used to back home. </Text>
  <Text ID="17790">Take a photo of any sail ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="17791">Dolphins can be accommodated in a Zoo.</Text>
  <Text ID="17792">Elephants can be accommodated in a Zoo.</Text>
  <Text ID="17793">Trains can only be found on rails, providing oil for electricity.</Text>

  <Text ID="9915">Willie needs help fulfilling an order made with two honourable gentleman, who have kindly corrected him as to the exact quantity of rum they agreed to pay for.</Text>
  <Text ID="9916">Willie needs more fuel to help perfect his latest conjuring trick, a spectacular that requires setting ships alight, that even he admits still needs practice.</Text>
  <Text ID="9917">Willie is obliged to hand out pocket watches every time someone guesses his trick correctly, unfortunately this has been happening rather a lot lately.</Text>
  <Text ID="9918">Willie has been taken in by confidence tricksters it seems, who now extort him for gold. Better help him out before they get too rough on him.</Text>
  <Text ID="9919">Willie seems to have become distracted during a routine trade, and his customer has *accidentally* taken all his timber, perhaps you can help him.</Text>
  <Text ID="9920">Willie thinks the reason his assistants keep quitting is because there aren't enough perks to the job, perhaps delivering him some glamorous outifts can help matters.</Text>
  <Text ID="9921">Willie has perhaps foolishly performed a magic trick involving a glass chandelier on a live audience. He hopes if you deliver him some glass, it can go as planned next time.</Text>
  <Text ID="18044">Willie would like you to bring him some tobacco, which he says, serves an important reminder of the sacrifices his late mother made to get him where he is.</Text>
  <Text ID="18045">Willie wants you to deliver him some fish oil to help keep his people fit and healthy. After all, that's where he got all his strength...</Text>
  <Text ID="9930">A rival conjuror keeps heckling Willie during his magic performances, divulging the not-so-secret secrets of his tricks. Willie wants you to help him get his own back by exchanging Astronomo's vital props for junk.</Text>
  <Text ID="9931">Willie could totally smash the great enemy his Board has appointed for him, but since you are his best apprentice, he has kindly granted that honour to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="9941">Willie has been pressured into criminal activity by his shady board of representatives, and is now getting his comeuppance. Perhaps you defeat his pursuers and help save his skin. </Text>
  <Text ID="18034">Willie is yet again afraid that some vengeful spirits have returned to collect their due from him, having sighted them near his shores, and he hopes you can banish them.</Text>
  <Text ID="9933">Willie's mum wasn't a believer in the five-second-rule, so depending on your own standards, he encourages you to pick up some goods that went missing on one of his trade routes.</Text>
  <Text ID="9934">Willie's insistence on conjuring for the men aboard his flagship didn't go down too well, when the morning after his performance he found all of his props had been thrown overboard. He hopes you might recover them for him.</Text>
  <Text ID="9935">Willie has been told to look after some crates by his shady board, with the added condition he be ignorant as to the contents. Now he wants to involve you in the mischief. Don't look in the boxes as you deliver them though! </Text>
  <Text ID="9936">Willie has spotted some boxes out in the ocean, after last time, he doesn't want to risk being the one to steal treasure that belongs to someone else. Someone scary. He suggests you grab it instead, if you're brave enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="9937">Willie is being pursued by the ghosts of his past, and wants to form a boundary of salt provided by Madame Kahina, to keep them at bay. To be honest, it sounds like his garden has a snail problem.</Text>
  <Text ID="9938">Willie has taken a chance on a random assortment of high-value black market treasures, and wants you to help him celebrate opening them up.</Text>
  <Text ID="9939">Willie has done a deal with a rough customer, who claims not to have the money to pay. Your job is to escort him home, and ensure he is as good as his word.</Text>
  <Text ID="9940">Willie is worried that without his wand, a vengeful spirit roaming the earth will finally descend upon him to take back a great treasure Willie once stole. He will need protection until he find it again.</Text>
  <Text ID="9942">Willie needs you to escort a shipment he guaranteed a client would be protected until it reached them. He thinks helping him will do you good.</Text>
  <Text ID="9943">Willie wants you to defend his ship against evil spirits while he gathers his powers to exorcise them for good. </Text>
  <Text ID="9944">Willie is bemused by the reaction of the general public to his stage performances, especially given that entry is free. Help him keep those who wish to scupper his career at bay.</Text>
  <Text ID="9932">Willie can't face carrying out what his shady board have asked, and hopes you taking his assassination target far away will be enough to convince the board he has done as they asked.</Text>
  <Text ID="18035">Willie is bursting with pride over his newly-opened factory, which he wishes his mum could have seen. Take a photo for Willie, and maybe she could— at one of Willie's "spiritual evenings". </Text>
  <Text ID="18036">Willie is disgusted that you haven't gotten around to building a variety theatre at which he might be able to tour his magic shows. He suggests you organise one as soon as humanly possible.</Text>
  <Text ID="18046">Willie finally admits that what he has been missing all this time is someone to look after him and comfort him. Perhaps what he means is someone willing to mop up his messes for him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18908">Willie has come up with a tremendous co-operative venture with the lovely Bente, although his idea seems rather a vague association, it might be best just to do exactly as he says.</Text>
  <Text ID="18037">Willie recommends you invite Barnfield's circus to your town to promote good feeling among your people. You'll need to build a big tent first, for which you need light and cloth.</Text>
  <Text ID="18038">Wilie thinks Barnfield's circus can only recover its former success if the existing freak show is replaced by the arrival of a performing elephant.</Text>
  <Text ID="18039">Willie hopes that by escorting Barnfield's circus troupe to your harbour, the circus spectacular can begin. Watch out though, Barnfield's reputation as a ruthless ringmaster means he has his enemies.</Text>
  <Text ID="18041">Willie has, perhaps foolishly, challenged a rival magician to a conjuring competition, As usual, he is in desperate need of assistance. For his trick, he asks you to deliver a lot of glass.</Text>
  <Text ID="18042">Willie's "Pepper Ghost" trick was a colossal failure. He finally accepts he might have been too ambitious, and plumps for a supposedly simpler trick. He needs you to bring him a bombin hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="18043">Having clearly lost the magic showdown, Willie does not enjoy being the subject of ridicule, and asks that you make his rival disappear once and for all.</Text>
  <Text ID="18047">Willie tells you the story of how he became rich, finding a sizeable treasure which he now keeps under lock and key. Not knowing who it originally belonged to however, keeps him awake at night. He thinks a vengeful spirit haunts his lighthouse, and wants you to take photographic proof.</Text>
  <Text ID="18062">You have given Willie proof of the phantom that stalks him, but now he wants your help to drive it away. Bring him some holy water from one of his baptismal fonts.</Text>
  <Text ID="18064">Willie now has the holy water with which to face his demons, but unfortunately finds himself falling asleep. Could you help keep him and his soldiers awake with coffee?</Text>
  <Text ID="18065">You are to pursue the mysterious phantom aboard his phantom ship, as Willie's quest to reserve all rights to his fortune comes to its spooky conclusion.  </Text>
  <Text ID="18066">The phantom haunting Willie turns out to be nothing more than a few of the board's cronies under a sheet trying to play on his conscience. You should return the sheet to Willie as proof he may have nothing to fear after all.</Text>
  <Text ID="18177">Bente loves animals, I know that much. If she and I are really to have a future together, we need to put those animals to use at the circus. Please deliver her my er.. business proposition!</Text>
  <Text ID="18180">Mmm, still tastes...like childhood doesn't it? I feel like I'm running down memory lane, my backside burning from the cane, all over again.</Text>
  <Text ID="16816">'I'll come down on you like a tonne of bricks' that big old bully used to say. Well let's see who has the last laugh, now we're all grown up eh?!</Text>
  <Text ID="16817">Alfred and Filbert are a lovely pair of shillings. Now, I couldn't remember if it were ten tonne or twenty owed. But being gents, they were quick to remind me it was thirty.</Text>
  <Text ID="16818">My latest trick is called "The Devil's Vessel" a fearful extravaganza of sea-fire! Got a bit hot the first time...'specially for the crew inside, but its getting there, it's getting there...</Text>
  <Text ID="16819">A pocket watch I can guess your card,' is how the trick starts. It should be impossible for them to guess it correctly as often as they do, just bad luck I s'pose.</Text>
  <Text ID="16820">Asking for gold, I was sure it was the ghost, come for his due. Luckily it's only a brigand, and he gave his word it'd just be this once!</Text>
  <Text ID="16821">Lord Flattenflee and I were having such a cultured cultural chat, that I think he loaded up a few too many crates! Haha. I've got loads more, course...but I do need those materials.</Text>
  <Text ID="16822">I get through quite a few stage assistants...I mean, you know, they leave. Can't take the city lights, the glamour. P'haps if they looked the part, they'd feel the part?</Text>
  <Text ID="17085">Woe is me! Jove and Juno converge upon me! I thought dangling those chandeliers above the audience was a genius idea! But it was the non-breaking sort of glass...as mum always said try and try again!</Text>
  <Text ID="18068">I probably told you, but I do miss my mum. She might have been big and frightening, occasionally violent, but I was a real nincompoop back in those days, I deserved all of it. You know what reminds me of her most? Raw tobacco from her evening pipe. Sends a shiver down my spine, it does.</Text>
  <Text ID="18069">...me old mum used to take good care of me when I was sick too. I remember those days in me straw bed, supping on stale—ah, crusty— bread, and gobbling down spoon after spoon of fish oil. Wonderful. Perhaps if you have any of the old stuff, I could give a little something back to the sick and needy, in honour of mum.</Text>
  <Text ID="16823">Why'd he have to shout out how its done?! Time that bully Astronomo got a huge kick up the interior, and have his show sabotaged for a change!</Text>
  <Text ID="16824">I'm caught between a frog and a toad! Board want off with a dangerous geezer. I'm like David, he like Goliath, but I've decided I'm going to leave all the glory to you!</Text>
  <Text ID="17089">I did what they told me, and now look where it's got me! There's no port I can reach for fear of my life, on account of one little tiny, tiny little... robbery...thingy.</Text>
  <Text ID="18070">I don't believe in coincidences. Those ships in the sea nearby belong to the spirits I have seen, their eyes emitting a pale blue light, cheeks drawn and skeletal. Blow'em up would you? </Text>
  <Text ID="21958">Eugh! You actually did it, and fished them out of the water? That's disgusting! What yer bringing 'em to me for? You picked the dirty things up, they're your problem now! </Text>
  <Text ID="16825">Whoopsie-widdly-daisy, them supplies must have fallen overboard and got all wet. Mum always told me never to pick things up once they're dirty, but you can have 'em if you like!</Text>
  <Text ID="16826">All my props are floating away! They say they chucked 'em because they was bored of my tricks, but we all know that can't be the reason! Something sinister is going on! It's almost as if I'm not the one in charge around here!</Text>
  <Text ID="16827">If I'm storing 'em, I should like to know what's in 'em. But it's me board, so we better do as we're told— save ourselves a lot of grief.</Text>
  <Text ID="17088">I paid upfront for some of those mystery loot crate things, to be collected from a top secret location! And I have chosen you, to take care of the grand unboxing!</Text>
  <Text ID="18537">Away from me fell spirits! No, not you... unless you can help me keep these tendrils of the netherworld from reaching over my threshold? Salt from Madame Kahina is what I need, to fashion a boundary they cannot cross!</Text>
  <Text ID="18727">As you may know, I have a good eye for treasure, and I've spotted some more at sea! 'Cept I won't go and get it myself, after what happened last time, so maybe you should go. If you're as brave as I was, that is!</Text>
  <Text ID="16829">Should have read the contract before signing, but you know, I think it's a good thing I agreed to protect every shipment— keeps friends like you in work, eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="16830">A the powerful sorceror, I will be below deck gathering a magik maelstrom, and you the simple soldier, shall hold off the fell spirits of the netherrealm until I am ready to banish them once and for all!</Text>
  <Text ID="16831">Who could possibly want to destroy my stage props? I have never asked a penny for any of my performances, and this is the respect I get! Make sure my magical apparatus arrives safe!</Text>
  <Text ID="17087">I may have remarkable powers, but I vowed only to use 'em for good, mostly. The board want me to do away with someone, and I can't do it, please, get them out of here would you?</Text>
  <Text ID="17090">Just because someone looks mean and has scars all over their face, don't presume them bad. Just an honest fellow who forgot his wallet, is all. Still, go along and double check on him, would yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="17091">Could have sworn I had it at Kahina's yesterday, where is my wand?! Good thing you are here to defend me, I never travel without it, for what if it—the ghost I mean— comes back to seize its rightful due?</Text>
  <Text ID="18072">Oh if my old mum could see my assembly line, it was only a thousand over budget! Wait...maybe she could. If you take a photograph, I could use the power invested in me to show her it during our next seance!</Text>
  <Text ID="18073">What do you mean you haven't got a variety theatre? It's on my tour bill—  the 2nd, the 17th and 24th you said, we were all really eager to come with our astonishing new act, so you better be ready!</Text>
  <Text ID="18074">Like I said, mum used to do a lot for me. Keep my socks together, comb my hair, rinse my bedpan. I don't have anyone like that around me now. D'you think maybe...you could find me someone? Not a replacement, like— I mean no-one can replace mum. Haha.</Text>
  <Text ID="18911">Lady Jorgensen is great with animals, while Willie is the best with magic! There is a huge opportunity in the making!</Text>
  <Text ID="18909">Willie wants a circus? To put animals on display and make them perform for us? Make a freak show of them? So sad that he, of all people, cannot see the wrong in that.</Text>
  <Text ID="21755">Ah, yes, Willie becomes lonely every once in a while. None of the maidens I recommend tolerate him for very long, since he has the bad habit of taking them for housemaids. Well, dear Lucy is, at least, a qualified one!</Text>
  <Text ID="18178">A fitting welcome for my menagerie of peculiarities! Much better than that interfering Wibblesock, who was really walking a tightrope with me!!</Text>
  <Text ID="18075">As a man almost great as me once said, "the noblest art is making yourself happy." I had Barnfield's circus come to town and cheer me up— you should too, especially since you're looking so down— first they'll need a big top!</Text>
  <Text ID="18076">Barnfield is making the tent as we speak! Sadly, he was telling me yesterday that his freak show hasn't really drawn the crowds of late. What he needs is an elephant! That'll really trumpet a new era of success.</Text>
  <Text ID="18077">Everything is set for your circus! All you need to do is escort Barnfield and his troupe to your harbour, and let the festivities begin. Watch out though, there's a few animal rights people mooching around, angry about the business with the elephant...</Text>
  <Text ID="18179">Ohhh! Cables and mirrors is how he did it, eh? Ha! Well no point wasting the secret of his spectacle now he's gone, is there?! By the way, you make an excellent assistant, would you be interested in a more permanent role? You'll get a Wibble Soc. badge!</Text>
  <Text ID="18078">The Ethereal Edwin Hartebeest shall vanish from the conjuring scene once he sees the wonderful Willie waving his wand! I shall win this magical tournament in whichever way I can. For my first joust, I shall need a lot of glass.</Text>
  <Text ID="18079">How was I supposed to know which bit was thin air and which bit was glass? Anyway, it's going to be an absolute nightmare to clean up, and all the while my rival Hartebeest conjures something devastating! I need a quick and easy follow-up trick. Bring me a hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="18651">Behold, before your very eyes, a disappearance of a magnitude never before seen! A whole ship VANISHES!</Text>
  <Text ID="18080">Impossible! How did he do that! Now everyone is calling my act rubbish. I call upon you, my faithful assistant, to excommunicate this dark wizard! And also...find out how his tricks are done...</Text>
  <Text ID="18181">A prank? White sheets? Nooooo! You think I, a noteworthy magician, would not have absolute faith in what I saw that in that photograph? On the occasion of that fearful visitation? I must remain vigilant. Still I appreciate all you've done for me, you've gone to great lengths for Willie and the Wibble Society, and I must acknowledge that. Did you already get your badge in the post?</Text>
  <Text ID="18081">Never told you how I made my fortune. Well, I found something...a great treasure. Quite near the family home actually. No idea who it belonged to, but it is foretold that they shall one day return and take bloody vengeance upon me! Only yesterday, there were reports of a shadow stalking about my lighthouse. Perhaps you could catch the phantom on film?</Text>
  <Text ID="18082">THERE IT IS! I KNEW IT! Now you've no reason to disbelieve me like everyone else does. We must find a way to dispel this ghost. Hey! What about holy water? From my church, like?</Text>
  <Text ID="18083">You know when you're so afraid it makes you sleepy? Well there's no point us having holy water to fight the phantom if we've fallen asleep when it floats near. Have you got anything to help keep our eyes pinned open?</Text>
  <Text ID="18084">The ghost! I saw him I swear! He was here in my room, white as a sheet over my bed, and wailing madly! I threw some holy water at him, and he yelped and flew from my window to his ghostly ship! What does he want with me? Please, help me face this spirit and try to reason with him!</Text>
  <Text ID="18085">Oi, take it easy! Since you've managed to catch us, you must be a bit sharper upstairs than your chum Willie. Obviously we're not vengeful spirits that walk the earth, just some hired hands they paid to put the fear of god up him. Here's the sheet we were under, take it if you want— he won't believe you.</Text>
  <Text ID="17292">George is acutely aware of the inadequacy of his medical provisions, and would like to offer some solace to those in direst need.</Text>
  <Text ID="17293">George wants to make travel easier for all and build a railway, believing the ability to travel to work will bring rich and poor closer together.</Text>
  <Text ID="17294">George hopes to receive a delivery of steam carriages from you, being extremely keen on technogical advancements that benefit society at large.</Text>
  <Text ID="17295">George would like you to deliver him a machine, believing they can increase efficiency, while also relieving the strain of manual labour upon his workers. </Text>
  <Text ID="17296">George wants you to bring one of his workers to him, who unfortunately met with an accident at the factory. George intends to offer his guarantees of new safety measures that will prevent this happening to anyone else.</Text>
  <Text ID="17297">George insists you do your bit by ferrying the poet Rupert Grayling across the sea to the land of the free, so that he may offer his wisdom to the orphanage.</Text>
  <Text ID="17298">George has bailed a prisoner to give him a chance at redemption, and would like you to escort him from Wormways to his new life on different shores.</Text>
  <Text ID="18434">George has been recruiting nurses in your town for his newly-built hospital, and would like you to trolley them over to the waiting room.</Text>
  <Text ID="18435">George has asked you to escort some juvenile criminals to Eli for sentencing. He argues that poverty does not excuse a person from their moral obligations.</Text>
  <Text ID="17299">George has discovered someone illegally trading in people, and wishes that they be captured and taken to Eli Bleakworth to face a criminal sentence.</Text>
  <Text ID="18436">George Smith and Anne Harlow have a peace treaty, but one of Anne's crews disobeyed and attacked a peaceful convoy of George's ships. To honour the treaty, Anne has sent the guilty crew to George to be dealt with. He however, has left the resolution to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="17300">George has presented you with a moral and ethical problem to solve, though you are not sure why he has chosen you. One thing is clear though, whatever you do will be better than doing nothing at all!</Text>
  <Text ID="17301">George wants you to save some drowning pirates and bring them to Eli, inevitably, to serve their time in Wormways prison, which George suggests, need not necessarily be time wasted.</Text>
  <Text ID="17303">George would like you to join him in building a trade union building, recently realising the hypocrisy of offering his people no place of their own to discuss work conditions and business.</Text>
  <Text ID="17304">George wants you to build a university, believing in addition to a basic education, everyone should have the chance to aspire to a life in academia.</Text>
  <Text ID="17305">George is concerned your museum lacks some generosity and suggests expanding it before hungry minds lose interest in it.</Text>
  <Text ID="17306">The Royal Council have just passed a new law improving sewage hygiene in cities, and George is very keen to have the full details of the edict so he can begin applying the law in the areas he governs.</Text>
  <Text ID="17307">George has arrested a modern day Robin Hood, trying to steal from the rich to alleviate the lives of the poor. He has made you his Sheriff of Nottingham, with the power to grant the boy a reprieve should you wish.</Text>
  <Text ID="17308">George cannot in good conscience allow Carl Von Malching's workers to suffer his oppressive rule any longer. He asks you to smuggle out as many workers as are willing to risk escape.</Text>
  <Text ID="17309">George has a birthday present for Bente, with whom he has much in common, and would like you to deliver it to her.</Text>
  <Text ID="18437">George wants you to rescue some child labourers and escort a schoolmaster recommended by Sir Archibald to George's island refuge, so that they get a chance in life to learn to read and write.</Text>
  <Text ID="18433">George is trying to encourage his friend Artur Gasparov to be more of a giving person. He has organised an auction for those in penury, and hopes Artur may be willing to donate a little something to the cause.</Text>
  <Text ID="17310">George has issued you an edict he recently fought for, that he believes will help improve conditions for people in your cities.</Text>
  <Text ID="17311">George is appalled to discover the shortage of food in your stores, and offers, for the sake of your people it must be said, to help you out.</Text>
  <Text ID="17312">George wants you to bring him a picture of the New World, so he has something to remember it by, for better or worse. </Text>
  <Text ID="18438">George wants you to take a picture of his workers outside their homes, believing he should not be ashamed to celebrate their present happiness.</Text>
  <Text ID="18439">George hopes to see you make use of some liberal legislation in your cities. He believes enacting more liberal edicts can sway the Royal Council towards passing laws that more directly improve the lives of ordinary people in the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="18440">George would like to see you making use of machines, which, as he may or may not have mentioned before, will be essential if people are to enjoy the new freedoms this century has brought them.</Text>
  <Text ID="18442">George is bothered that your people seem miserable, and suggests you do something about it in the name of progress.</Text>
  <Text ID="18443">George's worst fears came true when he began looking into the running of your mines. He urges you to reconsider your approach to working conditions, or risk further stirring his wrath.</Text>
  <Text ID="18444">George advises you learn from ancient peoples the best way to prepare for unforeseen barren spells by establishing a good fallback supply of food.</Text>
  <Text ID="18447">George has a dream of building a public library, and wants you to bring him the basic materials to do so.</Text>
  <Text ID="18448">George has his library, now he needs to start building a collection of book. He hopes you can snag him a couple of nice editions to get things going.</Text>
  <Text ID="18450">George has heard some refugees have capsized and would like you to rescue them and bring them to him so he can help them settle in. </Text>
  <Text ID="18452">George has helped the refugees with somewhere to stay, and would like your help to provide sailcloth so that they can put their previous expertise in shipbuilding to use in their new surroundings.</Text>
  <Text ID="18453">George seems to be pondering his decision to aid Isabel Sarmento, a leader of a revolutionary movement in the New World. He has asked you to accompany a delivery to ensure it arrives to her safely.</Text>
  <Text ID="18454">George wants you to distribute toys from Madame Kahina among the children of his city, believing there can never be too much love in the world.</Text>
  <Text ID="18455">George has heard with regret the news that slave traders still operate illegally in the New World. He asks only that you bring the perpetrators to justice.</Text>
  <Text ID="18456">George notices the slave operators you hunted down survived, and suggests taking them to Isabel. With her guidance, and rigorous rehabilitation, there is at least a slim chance they can be turned from evil. </Text>
  <Text ID="18457">George sends you to deliver a letter to Isabel Sarmento, without really explaining why it's so important to him. Perhaps the letter itself will offer some explanation.</Text>
  <Text ID="17317">I need liniments and gauzes, and I need them right away. There is an endless stream of the sick and suffering, but no institution to throw open its doors to them. The least we can do is let them help themselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="17318">One day, exploring the world won't only be a privilege of the rich but accessible to all thanks to the progress of global transportation. Help me realize that dream and build a railroad.</Text>
  <Text ID="17319">The Steam Carriage. Imagine a world in which we no more lay our burdens at the feet of beasts and men, and instead climb into the back seat ready to be driven into the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="17320">Why should anyone have to break their back when a machine, safely operated, can grant the common man some opportunity for leisure in the time he has saved?</Text>
  <Text ID="18488">I'm not sure Mr. Smith is quite aware how much these young offenders are likely to suffer here, I'm afarid my institution isn't particularly modern or enlightened. Very well, if you insist...</Text>
  <Text ID="18489">Ha! I wondered where the little monsters had got to. Don't you worry, Beryl will keep them all wrapped up in cotton wool, and maybe give them my ten cents on the subject of morality while I'm there!</Text>
  <Text ID="17321">I need you collect a special friend of mine. A man who lost his arm to the lathe. It is a tragedy I hold myself personally accountable for, and I wish to offer him assurances that we have learned our lessons from the incident.</Text>
  <Text ID="17322">If Rupert Grayling can find the time to read to every poor orphan on the other side of the ocean, you can damn well find the time to deliver him to them. </Text>
  <Text ID="17323">His accomplices won't like him being out of jail free, but everyone deserves a second chance. Who you were yesterday, who you are now, does not define who you will be tomorrow.</Text>
  <Text ID="17468">Ha! Not a single person has come out of my prison a better person. Once a criminal, always a criminal!</Text>
  <Text ID="18459">All the senseless wars around the globe have left us short of nurses, the lifeblood of the medical profession. I'm sure you don't mind, but I took the liberty of recruiting a new cohort in your town. Perhaps you can show them the way to my hospital?</Text>
  <Text ID="18460">Please escort these children to Eli, for they have committed an act of theft. Trust me, I know what it is like to be destitute, to be helpless. But you don't steal. If one man steals, the rest have the right to, and what kind of society is that? </Text>
  <Text ID="17324">No matter what progress has been made, what's important is to keep fighting the enslavement of our fellow man. There are those who still trade in people, and I want them gone, but I need you to go about this the right way. Their boat is empty, the time is right. Bring them before a judge!</Text>
  <Text ID="18461">This is the crew of rogues that disobeyed Anne Harlow, threatening the peace we worked so hard to put in place. Attacking a defenceless convoy like that— I'm too angry to know what to do with them, but I so believe Anne meant to offer them up as a sacrifice, so that our peace might survive...</Text>
  <Text ID="17373">The lives of the many over few, huh? Ever spare a thought for that old pastor, a man who  gave up his life to save so many others? Well don't lose any sleep, I hear a little old man got out of his bath chair and went and saved him.</Text>
  <Text ID="17374">One good man worth three bad? I'd say something like 'even bad men can change', if I didn't doubt the poor suckers were guilty in the first place. Well don't lose any sleep, I hear a little old man got out of his bath chair and went and saved them.</Text>
  <Text ID="17325">Let's say there are two ships. In one, a trio of juvenile criminals, in the other a gentle pastor returning from Sunday sermon. Both ships are sinking, who do you save? </Text>
  <Text ID="17326">Years in prison is better than a death at sea. A man has time to read, to write and many other things. Those who turn to piracy all have their reasons, many of them understandable, but at the end of it all, they are in the wrong. Take them to Eli.</Text>
  <Text ID="17327">You know, they always come to me and say things like 'Mr. Smith, why did you change that? I liked the night shift.' So I say look, there's somewhere you can go to sort out all these little details among yourselves!'</Text>
  <Text ID="17328">There's no gift like an education, I can tell you that much myself. I want you to prove to me you know how important that is to your people, for a society to grow its wings and soar.</Text>
  <Text ID="17329">Why haven't you grown your museum? That sort of style over substance reminds me of my old acquaintance Artur Gasparov. If I know my archaeology, I'd say you are a few asses short of a denarius.</Text>
  <Text ID="18491">So you would deliver someone to prison, even if he did what he did for the right reasons? Law is absolute? I'm sure you and Eli would get along well. </Text>
  <Text ID="18492">So according to you, a crime is justified if committed for the right reasons? Where do you draw the line? Or are you an anarchist, a lunatic, who draws no line in the sand at all?</Text>
  <Text ID="18487">Something of value to donate? Well, how about an evening with Gasparov? A candelit dinner (I mean what choice do we have!), my charming repartee, followed by a seemingly endless tour through my winter palace.</Text>
  <Text ID="21780">The boy looks truly repentant. I do believe his hand was forced by the misery of his loved ones. He has returned all the gold he stole, would you give it back to its rightful owner?</Text>
  <Text ID="21781">The rat won't stop crying and snorting, clenched this toy as if his life depended on it. Of course, I confiscated it right away. Take it, I won't hear another word about this "little girl" of his.</Text>
  <Text ID="17330">I had to campaign for that city hygiene edict for three years until the stubborn fools finally budged and voted with me, so I'd rather not wait a minute more, and risk another poor kid dying of cholera because his street is a stinking river of effluent! </Text>
  <Text ID="17331">A boy robs my bank, gets caught. But I believe him when he says the money was not for him, but the forgotten poor of a forgotten slum. Now you might just be able to put in a good word with Sir Archibald, save this boy from a life behind bars. What do you think?</Text>
  <Text ID="17332">I tried not to meddle, I tried. But Carl Von Malching's people are suffering! Working folk who have done no wrong, working days straight for barely a crust of bread for their broth! With your help, I mean to free as many as I can from his clutches, but you'll have to be discreet.</Text>
  <Text ID="17333">I may forget a lot of things, but I don't forget Bente's birthday. She's had a difficult time since her parents passed. Sure, she lives a life of privilege, but why hold that against a person, when they have as little choice in that as one born poor? </Text>

I always held him up as an example, my brother, of what I promised myself I would never be; unprincipled, a mercenary, a cruel and stupid sheep! To know what he was, it would have made mother so angry, so I told her Rafael had died a revolutionary, a hero, not the goon of a slave trader. Her face...she was so proud, so happy...

  <Text ID="18494">&lt;br /&gt;Isabel, dear child. You have grown so much since first I met you—  ferocious jaguar cub that you were. You had lost a brother, and I, a father. I had the years on my side back then, and the bounce of a freed man in my step. But I owe it to you to tell you, the price I paid for that freedom was high. I never found courage to tell you before now, but as the ever-quickening spectre of death approaches, I believe it is time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You always knew I had to be a runaway slave. Well, in order to escape the plantation, I had to kill a man. The one holding the whip. That man was your brother. I had to kill him to set us all free, a decision I have had to live with ever since, though I have to say, at the time I never saw it as a choice. I know, I came to you soon after, bearing the gift he intended for you, your name and his on the label, and I told you the lie that he'd died fighting in the resistance. I said he'd fought bravely against La Corona. The truth is, he was just a kid who'd fallen into the slave trade like so many others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that's all. May you find it within yourself to forgive me for depriving you of your only brother. Either way, I shall continue to support you until I draw my last breath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours, as ever, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. George Smith. </Text>

Never too old for play, never too old for love— and that's a word a slave barely knows but for the little game of stones that used to bring us together.</Text>
  <Text ID="18480">I think I've told you some of my story, so may as well continue. I have spent a much larger part of my life than anyone would like, wondering what it would be like to be free. That was the New World; a place where a struggle for freedom seemed to be taking place in every root and leaf of every tree around us. Somehow that struggle for light is still going on.</Text>
  <Text ID="18481">I see you spared them. Well, I'm glad, but I don't want anything to do with them. Take them to Isabel, she always finds a way to hold back the old anger, to lead these people back to a righteous path.</Text>

  <Text ID="14151">Gasparov has completed a fabulous design for a tropical house of the Royal Botanic Gardens, and wants it securely transported to Sir Archibald in case a rival architect tries to steal his idea. </Text>
  <Text ID="14152">Gasparov has pipped all the other bidders at auction and spent a vast quantity on some prise 15th century marbles, but is paranoid that without an escort, the slighted bidders may try to rob him of his new treasures.</Text>
  <Text ID="18189">Gasparov would like to have musicians play for him when he has his baths. Bring him some willing performers to add a little romance to his evening rinse.</Text>
  <Text ID="18190">Gasparov would like you to organise him a fashion event, for which you will need to provide escort for several noteable designers, a suitably chichi audience, and models that are pleasing to the eye.</Text>
  <Text ID="18195">Gasparov would like you to ensure a school of fragile ballerinas are kept safe from harm in transit to his conservatoire, where they are to enjoy a formal performance routine from the master himself. Gasparov hopes that through ballet, some connection to the grandeur of the past can be preserved, even in times of great change.</Text>
  <Text ID="18191">Gasparov would like to reaffirm feelings of self-confidence, which are known on very rare occasions to dip temporarily. He invites you to collect some adoring fans of his, so he can spend the evening hearing their fawning praise and thereby restore his ego to maximum. </Text>
  <Text ID="18193">Gasparov has made some fine invitations for persons of high culture he wishes to attend one of his current exhibitions, and calls upon you to deliver them with great care. </Text>
  <Text ID="18194">Gasparov is disappointed that an eastern princess has confiscated a trio of exquisite vases so they can be returned to their point of origin. He would like you to bribe those tasked with returning the vases, so that he can return them to display in his galleries.</Text>
  <Text ID="18196">Gasparov is tortured by the possibility that followers of the despotic Alonso Graves freely roam his city, and that this heralds a coming apocalypse. He asks you to find and remove them from his city before the fall of man begins.</Text>
  <Text ID="18183">Gasparov wishes to modernise the public sculptures in his city, and has identified several sculptures he'd like you to dismantle, that he believes to be artistically obsolete.</Text>
  <Text ID="18197">Gasparov is embarassed to discover you have no monument to show off to the world, and recommends starting constructing one, if you don't want to be left behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="18198">Gasparov wants you to prove you can maintain your cellars of champagne, because to have only a few bottles here and there only makes you look like a society fraud.</Text>
  <Text ID="18199">Gasparov is disgusted at the number of statues in your city that were not designed by him, and wants you to destroy these false idols at once. </Text>
  <Text ID="18200">Unsurprisngly, Gasparov wants you to build the statues he designed, rather than those of his rivals. He also wants you to do it right away.</Text>
  <Text ID="18201">Gasparov is looking for a cover image of his island to sell a few copies of the newspaper. He believes the sheer beauty of such a photograph, taken by you, cannot fail to win over any of his doubters.</Text>
  <Text ID="18202">Reluctant as always to leave his work and his island, Gasparov would like a photograph of your monument so that he can assimilate anything he things worthy enough into his own designs. At least he is honest.</Text>
  <Text ID="14153">Gasparov has been told by his psychoanalyst that he needs to get out more, and in particular to take sea air. He would like someone to go boating with.</Text>
  <Text ID="14154">The rolling sea has sent Gasparov into a panic - he worries he may be permanently separated from his work, and demands you escort him home.</Text>
  <Text ID="18204">Collect a renowned painter by the name of Van Ruff from Sir Archibald's island, and bring him to Gasparov so that he can capture the great man in portrait.</Text>
  <Text ID="18205">An exasperated Gasparov wants you to track down the thieves who stole Van Ruff's paintings. Once they are returned to the artist, he might agree to produce Gasparov's portrait.</Text>
  <Text ID="18206">On discovering the thieves have sold off all of Van Ruff's best pieces already, Gasparov suggests you visit Madame Kahina, whose knowledge in the area of high value auctions is unsurpassed.</Text>
  <Text ID="18207">His paintings returned, Van Ruff has agreed to produce Gasparov's portrait, and is currently in the mountains to inspire him to finish. Gasparov has asked for an update on progress. </Text>
  <Text ID="18208">Gasparov has heard of a particularly special tailor who makes the most of cheap materials, and wants to see her in person, to know what she has to offer. He wants you to escort her to his island.</Text>
  <Text ID="18209">Though the materials she has requested to work with are expensive, Gasparov is full of admiration for the bravery of the new tailor he has invited to produce clothes for him. In particular the minimalism of her style. He asks you to find her what she needs to create him his own bespoke garment.</Text>
  <Text ID="18210">Gasparov is naked, totally naked. It seems that instead of weaving him an outfit, the tailor he trusted has run off with all the riches you provided. Yet Gasparov seems blissfully unaware, and asks you to take a photograph of him in his "new clothes" so that this...enduring image can be shared with all.</Text>
  <Text ID="16961">Gasparov is planning to construct the most ambitious statue ever unveiled on Sir Archibald's island High Clarence Hall, and wants your help with the materials for the statue's foundations.</Text>
  <Text ID="16962">Gasparov's ambitious project to build a modern colossus will be worthless unless he has the best living sculptor working on it. Mssr. Raisin was last seen indulging at Madame Kahina's Emporium. </Text>
  <Text ID="16963">Gasparov's ambition to build a modern colossus has encountered a hitch. Armand Raisin, the only sculptor Gasparov will consider, has caused a scene at Kahina's emporium and will have to be released from prison if the project is to continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="16964">Despite his undeniable talent, Armand Raisin has not been quite as reliable as hoped in his sculpture work. Still, a bit of gold can cover up anything, according to Gasparov.</Text>
  <Text ID="16966">Gasparov is so caught up in the magic of the grand unveiling of his Colossus, he has forgotten to arrange transport for his distinguished guests to the unveiling Sir Archibald is hosting.</Text>
  <Text ID="17428">Everything I have heard suggests this Armand Raisin's behaviour at Madame Kahina's fine establishment was despicable, the only artistic talent I see is one for painting the gutter, so if you want him you'll have to pay.</Text>
  <Text ID="16939">How could they forget something as simple as windows! You know, it is the one thing that has kept me from my World's Fair— from my apotheosis! </Text>
  <Text ID="16940">Are you the catering people? We'll need champagne, lots of it. Mssr Vichyssoise could arrive any minute, and I need that investment!</Text>
  <Text ID="16941">Within a room a mirror, and in the mirror the room, to infinity, but with sound! Like the groan of mother nature giving birth at the moment of creation!</Text>
  <Text ID="16951">The wretched things are sealed into the crystal, I am going to have to start these chandeliers all over again, but this time you better damn well bring me lighting that functions! </Text>
  <Text ID="16942">Nothing is more vulgar and despicable than the sailor, their debaucheries are an insult to my toweers and temples! Banish them from my threshold!</Text>
  <Text ID="18211">I will not have the tour of my island ruined by pirates yet again! Those barbarians don't realise the importance of my guests being fully immersed in the work, so as to form meaningful connections with it! I want you to escort the group, ensuring only the right sort of people are among them!</Text>
  <Text ID="18238">Oh dear, is this really what they looked like? But honestly, I had no idea how tawdry and mundane this particular line of miliner fashions now seems. At least, I suppose, I can look forward to punching my fist through the lot of them.</Text>
  <Text ID="16943">I sent fifty-score hunters to capture the bird with the gilt lashes, and now that it has been found, those incompetents lost it at sea! Bring it to me, and my golden salon shall be complete!</Text>
  <Text ID="16944">I hear further rumourd of that wreck, and as you know, only monastic era inks, writing implements and vellum can suffice to illuminate the true and complete history of me and my miracles. </Text>
  <Text ID="16945">Browsing Madame Kahina's marvellous Emporium is the only real pleasure I ever allow myself, But if I collect my order I shall be in there forever, when vital projects need my supervision!</Text>
  <Text ID="18213">Where have you been?! My darlings are lost! Lost I tell you! An entire collection of made-to-measure hats and headpieces that cannot be replaced! The last time I saw them they were in excellent condition, still more than capable of impressing that feeling of timeless grandeur upon all who lay eyes upon them.</Text>
  <Text ID="16946">It is a VERY rare treat when mon ami Frederic Chaplain performs. You must therefore attend to every detail of his cavalcade so that nothing, NOTHING! is left to chance!</Text>
  <Text ID="16947">There are petty rivals of mine who might try to steal my plans for the tropic house of Her Majesty's garden, as they claim I did theirs. Make sure the plans arrive safely!</Text>
  <Text ID="16948">They are of course, priceless. But since I beat the others to them at auction, I want you to keep them under wraps until they are safely returned to me. The jealous are everywhere! </Text>
  <Text ID="18214">Bath time is a time of reflection for me. I watch as ideas evolve in the sparkle of water, glimpse beauty in the mirrors and mosaic tiles. To hear music then, could only heighten the sweetness of that self-absorbtion. As if my genius were resonating with the gently-strummed lyre of Apollo himself.</Text>
  <Text ID="18215">Dr. Fraud suggests I hold more social gatherings, events, so that I remain in regular contact with other... people. I have chosen you to prepare a festival of fashions in my city, for which I shall want the finest clothes, and therefore, the finest designers. Oh, and there'll no doubt be a few accessory tasks as well.</Text>
  <Text ID="18219">Where are the ballerinas? Only they have the power, in this era of tumult, to leap gracefully the terrible chasm between tradition and modernity! I shall have to do some stretching beforehand of course, it has been a while, but I hope these young and fragile talents aspire to, at least in some part, my degree of mastery over the form.</Text>
  <Text ID="18216">I have been receiving some critique of late that I have taken rather to heart. I need someone to massage my ego, to tell me I am wonderful, even though I know it already. I keep a little circle of  adulators I call upon for such occasions. Bring them here safely so I can hear my name spoken on glowing terms once more.</Text>
  <Text ID="18217">I have taken the utmost care in having these card invitations to my upcoming design exhibition printed. It is therefore upon you, as a common courtesy, to keep those very fine etchings from smudging, bending or creasing in any regard, as you deliver them to the chosen few.</Text>
  <Text ID="18218">I cannot bear to see such beauty torn away from those specially-commissioned pedestals forever! I don't care if her people made those vases in the first place, they have changed hands a hundred times since, and yet this is the first time anyone expressed any regret they were missing. What I am saying is why me?! Please, persuade them somehow to relent!</Text>
  <Text ID="18220">I see civilisation crumbling in their bloodshot eyes, great monuments to thought and ideas toppled by their scabby hands. The followers of Graves must be removed from this sacred place, before they incite some barbarous counter-movement, based on nothing more substantial than a skull motif!</Text>
  <Text ID="18212">Gargoyles and meat-limbed eyesores! I don't know what whoever built these sculptures was thinking! Tear them down this instant!</Text>
  <Text ID="18221">Grand monuments are an opportunity for eminent persons to show they belong among the elite, I suggest you get yourself one, the foundations at least, unless you intend to diminish forevermore into insignificance?</Text>
  <Text ID="18222">I am still cringing from hearing the news about your stocks of champagne. Have you any idea how embarassing it is in polite society, not to have a full and complete cellar of vintage? First impressions are everything, everything!</Text>
  <Text ID="18223">The shame of it! I make the most beautiful statues in the known, even the unknown world, and you can only think to parade the feeble stone splodges of my rivals? I don't think I shall ever be calmed until you smash them all to tiny bits!</Text>
  <Text ID="18224">Since your city is unsullied by the hideous statues of my contemporaries, why not take this opportunity to build something of genuine verve and elan? If that's not clear enough, I mean you are to build my statues on every street corner!</Text>
  <Text ID="18226">My island is so picturesque at this moment that it begs to be photographed. I cannot even begin to imagine how many copies of the next newspaper edition it will sell on the cover image alone. So set up your camera please, and remember that I will hold you personally responsible if you fail to capture that essential beauty!</Text>
  <Text ID="18227">I can't visit of course, but I still want to see your monument so I can decide in which respect to massively improve upon it. Bring me a photograph that shows the edifice from all angles, so I can cherry pick any ideas I deem worthy of iteration.</Text>
  <Text ID="16949">Dr. Fraud believes some bracing sea air will do me good, that I spend too long cooped up in my bureau poring over my magnum opus. Can you show me the sort of place he is talking about?</Text>
  <Text ID="16950">What if I were lost to these waves forever!? Gasparov drowned and forgotten?! Reunite me with the shore this instant, or I shall never forgive you! </Text>
  <Text ID="18239">I don't deal in fine art. Too cutthroat for me, these days at least, but I do know some art merchants that were almost certainly involved.</Text>
  <Text ID="18240">It was such a relief to have my paintings returned to me, thank you! Indeed, you have arrived at the perfect time, because I think I have finished my portrait of Gasparov. Here!</Text>
  <Text ID="18241">What? What is this!? A crude and vulgar piece of amateur sketchwork! But I had it on good authority this Van Ruff was a talent! He is nothing but an impostor on the art scene, with the hand and eye of a labourer! If you dare speak a word to anyone of this indignity, this travesty of a painting!</Text>
  <Text ID="18228">It's the name that I like more than anything; Van Ruff. I haven't seen any of his work but from the reports of Sir Archibald, I'd be a fool not to have him attempt my portrait! Bring him here so I may sit for him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18229">The heathen refuses to paint me, and threatens never to show his work in public again after thieves stole his paintings! Excuses and more excuses! You! Return Van Ruff his paintings, I will have my portrait!</Text>
  <Text ID="18230">Those artless brigands have already sold off Van Ruff's pieces at ludicrous valuations! I can only think Madame Kahina might have some knowledge of the movements of work of that magnitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="18231">Finally with most of his work returned, Van Ruff has agreed to paint me. He is in the mountains at the moment, finalising his sketchwork. I'm very busy, please can you see how things are progressing?</Text>
  <Text ID="18232">I have heard rumour of a tailor who can produce the most fabulous garments from the humblest of materials. I can admire good clothes, so please, bring her here.</Text>
  <Text ID="18233">She's quite something that tailor. You see the material she showed me is luminous enough to be almost imperceptible, so finely is it woven. She will of course rely on the finest materials, as the best always do, when she is fashioning me a costume of my very own to wear. Please would you hurry along and source some for her?</Text>
  <Text ID="18234">The tailor says it looks abslutely perfect on me, perfect! Everyone I have spoken to has lowered their heads, in what can only be described as deference to the divine! No matter that it was expensive, no matter. What matters is that I am so photogenic now! Please capture me on film, so that the world may embrace the emperor's new look!</Text>
  <Text ID="16967">My Colossus! Successor to the giant sculptures of classical tradition, perhaps the work closest to my heart— it's made of stone after all. The Queen herself has asked for it to be built at High Clarence Hall. The sketches are finished, the bozettos made! I just need materials— first for the foundation...</Text>
  <Text ID="16968">I cannot hope to outdo what has been and gone in sculpture without the best possible sculptor. Perhaps Armand Raisin can be found, as the best always are, at that delightful emporium.</Text>
  <Text ID="16969">You must see Armand is released, that he is on edge is inevitable when he has so little stimulation! As you know I have the perfect antidote— my Colossus!</Text>
  <Text ID="16970">My Colossus must be indulgent, lavish! An excess of gold will make up for almost any slips that Raisin has made, I should never have permitted him to work in such a bohemian manner!</Text>
  <Text ID="16971">A Colossus is built! I am elevated to a select pantheon of architects, and you...yes well you may bask beneath my golden rays once you have ferried the dignitaries to the private view at High Clarence Hall. </Text>
  <Text ID="17427">You're looking for Raisin? He's back at the green fairy and caused a ruckus, they had to take him to the cells.</Text>
  <Text ID="17843">Look for the sculptor on Madame Kahina's island. He is in the gardens, close to the huntress statue.</Text>
  <Text ID="2381">"I am awaiting new police officers..."</Text>
  <Text ID="2382">"You might want to get an impression how your facilities work"</Text>
  <Text ID="2384">"These sails will help you to deliver stuff in time"</Text>
  <Text ID="17489">Carl doesn't believe you can have progressed far enough to need all the bricks you are producing, and wants them for himself.</Text>
  <Text ID="17490">Carl finds chocolate disgusting, but knows its importance when hob-nobbing with the rich and influential at his soirees.</Text>
  <Text ID="17491">Carl would like you to bring him some heavy armaments, believing shows of force are an important tactic in keeping his workers quiet and obedient. </Text>
  <Text ID="17492">Carl wants you to deliver some quartz sand so that he is able to make his worker's gruel go further, and ideally, make it seem so unappetising that his workers will forgo eating entirely.</Text>
  <Text ID="17502">Carl has devised a scheme to sell brass as gold, and it seems to be going so well, he wants you to bring him more of the stuff.</Text>
  <Text ID="17539">Carl is so mean, he even wants to charge the workers for the clothes they work in. He thinks if they come from you, his workers won't join up the dots and see how unfair that is. </Text>
  <Text ID="17555">Carl has no scruples about tricking his workers into working longer by installing light bulbs. He just needs you to bring him some so he can get to work.</Text>
  <Text ID="17616">Carl's initial plans have stalled due to shortages of timber, and he demands that you bring him some, since you probably have access to plenty of the stuff.</Text>
  <Text ID="17617">Carl seems to be building a vault in the mountains with the intention of hoarding all of his ill-gotten gains there. By providing wood and steel you would be helping him connect the vault to his empire by rail.</Text>
  <Text ID="18662">Carl has become acquainted with a very nice old lady, who just so happens to be extremely rich. With no husband or children to take care of her, Carl has stepped in. He would like you to organise a gift of coffee, so he can keep her company in the afternoons.</Text>
  <Text ID="18663">Carl is running out of patience looking for gold in the New World, and would like you to deliver some dynamite to him there to speed up the process.</Text>
  <Text ID="17619">Carl has identified a threat to his business in the up and coming Cuthbert &amp; Co. He thinks sinking one of their key shipments will also see their bright star fade from view.</Text>
  <Text ID="17620">Carl denies all knowledge of a debt that someone claims he owes. Rather than pay it off, Carl asks you to make the matter go away, whatever that may entail.</Text>
  <Text ID="17621">Carl is furious that a group of workers are trying to start a trade union to protest against mistreatment. Fearing for their lives they are conducting the meeting out at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="17622">Carl is disappointed at reports of his cities being polluted in a local news outlet, and wants you to put these hurtful stories to bed once and for all.</Text>
  <Text ID="17623">Carl has been snubbed in business, and he wants you to hunt down the one who outbid him so that he'll get the contract instead.</Text>
  <Text ID="18664">Carl has heard one of his vessels has wrecked at sea. Blaming it on the sailors, he asks that you ignore any survivors and recover what's left of the cargo.</Text>
  <Text ID="18665">Carl has noticed that his shoreline looks a little dirty, and would like your help in a beachcombing effort to clean the place up.</Text>
  <Text ID="18666">Carl has concocted an insurance fraud, which requires you to destroy two of his empty ships and return him some evidence of accident. He then intends to submit a claim as if they were fully laden with goods...</Text>
  <Text ID="18667">Carl has lost a ship in imperial waters, and seems to think this makes the accident the fault of the Queen. He wants you to gather what remains of the ship to support is legal case against the crown.</Text>
  <Text ID="18668">Carl's police have identified the instigators of a recent riot in his settlement, and he wishes you to escort them through the angry crowd to jail. </Text>
  <Text ID="18669">Carl thinks he has found a machine that will greatly increase the profits from his factories, but he is afraid others may want to steal the secret designs unless you protect them.</Text>
  <Text ID="18670">Carl is astonished at your shortage of banks. He wants you to build more, not for your sake, but for the sake of the economy. </Text>
  <Text ID="18671">Carl is disgusted to hear the Royal Council intends to pass a law that reduces working hours, and wants you to secretly replace the proposed edict with an idea of his own.</Text>
  <Text ID="18672">Carl is looking for an island in the New World with gold on it, and would like you to take a photograph if you find one.</Text>
  <Text ID="18685">Carl has managed to pass a local bylaw that permits labourers to work from a younger age, and recommends you do the same.</Text>
  <Text ID="18687">In order to assess your worth, Carl wants to know if you can sustain a healthy balance in your business ventures, or if you really are as incompetent with money as he always believed.</Text>
  <Text ID="18679">It dawns on Carl that his letter of proposal to Bente Jorgensen may never have arrived, and urges you to deliver a replacement.</Text>
  <Text ID="18681">Not content to read between the lines of Bente's letter, Carl assumes she is playing hard-to-get. </Text>
  <Text ID="18682">Not to be denied, Carl decides to make a second dress to woo Bente, this time like the sky at night she described.</Text>
  <Text ID="18683">Desperate to be rid of Carl Von Malching's greasy advances, Bente asks you to deliver a letter to Carl. In it, she tells Carl she will marry him, but only on condition that he renounce his family name, and any claims to titles he may have.</Text>
  <Text ID="18688">Due no doubt to some insider tip-off, Carl believes the price of cigars is about to go through the roof, and wants to get his ships to Madame Kahinas unhindered, so that he can buy up all her stock.</Text>
  <Text ID="18689">Carl bought all his cigars from Kahina, thanks to the escort you provided, and now thinks its time to sell. He wants you to do it for him, though one can't help but think there's something funny going on.</Text>
  <Text ID="18690">Carl's cigars turned out to be imitations made of wax. Understandably, his clients are not too happy about it.</Text>
  <Text ID="18691">The Queen and Sir Archibald appear to be ignoring Carl's claims to the title of Baron. He asks you, as a fellow person of standing, to make the case to Archie on his behalf, along with a pleading letter.</Text>
  <Text ID="18692">Carl confesses that the documents Sir Archibald needs to verify his claim to a barony are still lost in the nearby mountains where his first wife had her carriage... accident. He wants to avoid going up there himself.</Text>
  <Text ID="18693">Sir Archibald seems satisfied with the basic evidence for Carl's claim to a barony, however he wants proof Carl will come to the service of the Queen in her hour of need.</Text>
  <Text ID="18694">Upon hearing that all he needs to claim his barony is for his old family castle to be restored, Carl asks you to fetch some materials so he can't start building right away.</Text>
  <Text ID="18695">Realising he can't afford to restore the family castle, Carl asks you to photograph something else instead and take it to Archie, pretending it's just part of the refurbishment.</Text>
  <Text ID="18696">Sir Archibald is finally ready to admit that Carl can have his Barony. All that remains is for you to escort Von Malching to the ceremony.</Text>
  <Text ID="3137">You, lumberjack, bring me more timber! There's a bottleneck in my prime opening strategy— and I keep running low on it. House Von Malching used to own entire forests, until the state repossessed them!</Text>
  <Text ID="2385">Choo-choo! The locomotive of progress splinters the bones of inefficiency! Deliver wood and steel for my gold vault in the mountains, or I shall derail with impatience! </Text>
  <Text ID="3095">I'm always aware about security in my realm...</Text>
  <Text ID="3583">I happen to need all the bricks I can find for a gigantic smog of new factories! Besides, what ambitions could someone like you possibly have for bricks?</Text>
  <Text ID="3586">With plenty of potent cannons dotted about the place, my workers will soon remember their place, and my profits will be launched into the stratosphere!</Text>
  <Text ID="3587">I curate an exclusive party for the grotesquely rich— that's me—and damn chocolates are the fashion! I abhor those obnoxious, sticky cubes— you fetch them!</Text>
  <Text ID="3859">Do you know, very few people actually know what real gold looks like? The fools have never seen it! So please, bring me some more brass!</Text>
  <Text ID="3861">If they want work rags, they'll have to pay for them themselves! If you were to bring me some stamped with your clothing label, they'd never realise how perversely unfair this whole arrangement is! </Text>
  <Text ID="3863">Lightbulbs, with their bulbous luminescence, shall dangle from my every factory shack from here to Mandalay, so that my workers have no idea what time of day it is!</Text>
  <Text ID="3864">Everyone but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept hungry, makes sure my workers can never again complain their food is lacking in texture! I intend to cut it with Quartz Sand!</Text>
  <Text ID="18698">I have met an older lady I absolutely adore. If I had some coffee we could spend the afternoons as her companion, discussing her great wealth, and also perhaps, the apparent lack of an heir to it... </Text>
  <Text ID="18699">I have not found anywhere near as much gold out in the New World as anticipated! There must be something you can bring me there to speed up the process of destruction and deforestation?</Text>
  <Text ID="2993">I don't like the speed at which the trading company Cuthbert &amp; co. progress. If a key shipment of theirs were to go missing, I should think their trading days will soon be numbered!</Text>
  <Text ID="3645">People I have never before laid eyes upon, come to me, a Baron-to-be, and claim I owe them money! I am counting on you to set my slanderous accusers straight!</Text>
  <Text ID="3646">The worthless workers have agglutinated into a secret 'trade union' out at sea, voting on better conditions! Fewer Hours! Safety Measures! This makes a mockery of the social order! I want it dissolved!</Text>
  <Text ID="3647">That nosy news-monger has once again belittled my city, saying it is thick with pollution! Rubbish, I know for a fact the minerals in the air strengthen the lungs! Skewer that polecat before he can print another word!</Text>
  <Text ID="3649">That filthy swine has backed out, claiming he has a better offer! Well what if this better offer were suddenly to disappear?</Text>
  <Text ID="3143">If the crown rules the waves, why have the waves sunk my ship!? Is the Queen as feeble as King Canute? Bring me proof of the wreck, so I can sue her and that Blake for all they have...</Text>
  <Text ID="3775">You, sea comber! I have need of an unwashed whelk to scrape up the foetid debris from my otherwise-impeccable sea dunes!</Text>
  <Text ID="3832">Amateurish jack tars who couldn't handle a few waves, it would appear. Apparently some have survived...but what do I care! Bring me back my possessions!</Text>
  <Text ID="3833">Once you have destroyed those two empty ships of mine, you are to recover the debris.That way those insufferable amoebae from the offices of law won't question my insurance claim! I'm expecting to get a full return, including remittance for the non-existent cargo!</Text>
  <Text ID="3901">My police should have the instigators of those riots lined up and shot! But it seems gaol will have to suffice. Take them away, and pay no attention to the angry mob!</Text>
  <Text ID="3902">Imagine getting your mitts on a machine that does the work of a hundred weaklings! No more factory rats, snivelling and complaining! Keep the ship bearing those blueprints safe!</Text>
  <Text ID="18700">What do you have against banks? After a while it is the only thing worth building if the divide between rich and poor is to reliably grow!</Text>
  <Text ID="18701">The Royal Council is about to pass a law that  allows them to take days off! Just when I thought workers couldn't be any lazier. Go there in secret and replace it with my own, much more sensible legislation...</Text>
  <Text ID="18702">All that gold that must be out there in the New World, I can hear it gleam! If you do happen to see an island with an aura of the auric, do take a picture of it for me... </Text>
  <Text ID="18703">Alas! The child no more than eight and wasted by fever, struggles weakly against the wind as another grueling day at the mill begins... Sound like excellent business? Then here, exercise this edict, and never suffer seeing a child idle again! </Text>
  <Text ID="18704">What kind of competition are you? If your financial accounts are anything to go by, I'd say 'measly'. Or perhaps you can show me how I underestimate you...?</Text>
  <Text ID="18719">If I keep putting the leery letters of that odious man in the fire, he may come rapping at my door in person *shudders*. Please take this letter to him, and say that while I am grateful for his offer, I cannot accept. </Text>
  <Text ID="18720">Then the dress is ready. The moment she sees it, she will wilt into my waiting arms.</Text>
  <Text ID="18721">Some may find that pretty...but perhaps it may surprise you to learn that I prefer a dress dark and laced with mystery, like the sky at night.</Text>
  <Text ID="18722">I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but...I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh! Please help, I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait...an idea occurs to me...I shall write to  accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles! </Text>
  <Text ID="18723">Renounce my rightful claim to baroncy, further disgrace the family name? The girl is mad as a box of frogs! She's madder than my last wife, and we all know what had to happen to her...sorry, I mean, what accidentally happened to her.</Text>
  <Text ID="18706">The only possibility is that my offer of marriage never arrived, else I would already have received Miss Jorgensen's effusive letter of acceptance! Promise you'll be more reliable than the last nitwit postman...</Text>
  <Text ID="18707">Oh it is clear from her letter she is just coy. I shall woo her with a gift that oozes opulence...a dress fashioned from sun-glist threads, and gold. Huhuhuhuhuh.</Text>
  <Text ID="18708">She too, must enjoy the thrill of the chase! If she wants a dress as glittering as the milky way, that is no less than she shall have!</Text>
  <Text ID="18709">I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but...I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh! Please help, I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait...an idea occurs to me...I shall write to  accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles! </Text>
  <Text ID="18710">As I'm sure you know, I am a master of the markets, and I sense the price of cigars is set to skyrocket! Quickly, get me to Madame Kahina's without interruption so I can buy everything she has!</Text>
  <Text ID="18711">Good, good...now it's time to sell those sought-after cigars. Perhaps I can leave the sale to you? Though I recommend you don't let them see the merchandise before you are already far away... </Text>
  <Text ID="18712">Why is this box so light? Wait a minute...they're all fake! Don't think you can trick us and live to tell the tale!</Text>
  <Text ID="18724">I do sympathise with Carl, but I'm afraid covering yourself in feathers doesn't make you a cockerel. The only chance for him to succeed in this matter will be to provide formal evidence to support this rather audacious claim.</Text>
  <Text ID="18725">Did Mister Von Malching really defeat those enemies of the Empire singled-handedly? I must say, it all seems rather suspicious you coming to me in his stead each time. Still, I may have neglected to mention, but he will never be a baron without a castle anyway...</Text>
  <Text ID="18726">Hahaahahaha! They have no idea how little, and yet how much I deserve this...Baron Von Malching at last! I do hope you'll keep all the juicy details of how it came about a secret...</Text>
  <Text ID="18713">I have waited long enough! My polite requests to restore my barony to me, seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Take this letter to Blake, use all your puny powers of influence to force their hand!</Text>
  <Text ID="18714">I knew that stuffed bird would want proof. Well the truth is the family scrolls fell down the mountainside during the...accident. *Carl erupts in melodrama* Woe is me! Forsooth, I cannot return to that ill place, lest I discover my lost love roaming those hills. They say she still shrieks my name, as was always her terrible habit.</Text>
  <Text ID="18715">Sir Archibald was forced to admit that my family lineage suggests I am due a Barony. But now he is muttering something about defending the Queen should the need arise. Sounds like a job for you, not me...</Text>
  <Text ID="18716">They keep finding ways to dodge my perfectly legitimate requests, don't they? Well if it's a castle they want, a castle they shall have. While I work out how to restore my family castle to be grander even than the royal palace, you fetch me some materials!</Text>
  <Text ID="18717">I...I... can't rebuild the family castle, it's proving far too expensive! And the maintenace costs I'll incur later on... I have another idea, I took a clipping of a palace out of a cheap novelette. Take it and pretend it is part of the renovation, they'll never know!</Text>
  <Text ID="18718">So this is Von Malching's family castle? It certainly looks different to my memory of it. I gather he opted for a more modern design, which shows commendable practicality. I see no choice but to give the man what he wants, you better bring him here...</Text>
  <Text ID="21959">Look for the remains of the accident on the mountains of Carl von Malching's island.</Text>
  <Text ID="3166">Alonso would like some bricks for a maze; seems like some sort of initiation, or test of faith for his disciples...</Text>
  <Text ID="3165">Alonso would like you to bring him some more schnapps, it would seem, to put the disciples at his door into some ritual trance.</Text>
  <Text ID="3167">Alonso is after a few more animals he hopes will help him predict the future. He wants you to deliver some to him.</Text>
  <Text ID="3589">Alonso wants you to fetch him some pigs for a bathing ritual those in civilised society might call gruesome, but that he claims is good for the skin.</Text>
  <Text ID="3677">Alonso would like you to bring him some bicycles in order to conduct some macabre experiment on those unwise enough to follow him. It also involves his pet tigers...</Text>
  <Text ID="3590">It's coconut season, and Alonso Graves and his merry band are having difficulty getting them open. He hopes perhaps you can provide a simpler solution. </Text>
  <Text ID="3886">Alonso has decided its time for a new eating regime for his following, and would like you to deliver a very unlikely combination to get them off to the best possible start in the mornings.</Text>
  <Text ID="3164">"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text>
  <Text ID="18466">Alonso wants champagne. He seems well aware of the contradiction to his philosophy in needing such an intensively cultivated product, but is willing to forgive himself in order to experiemce such a divine sensory pleasure.</Text>
  <Text ID="3172">Alonso wants to test your animal instincts when bearing down on prey, and asks you to stalk down one ship in particular. But watch out! The herd are likely to band together against any would-be predators...</Text>
  <Text ID="3685">Alonso desires to escalate a conflict between two local warlords who wish to prove themselves worthy of becoming his vassal, in order to see which will be the better 'partner'.</Text>
  <Text ID="3686">Alonso wants you to destroy...him. Or one of his ships at least. For what reason your guess is as good as anyone's.</Text>
  <Text ID="3688">Alonso is dismayed to discover that the crew of a ship belonging to a local warlord has been interfering with the local dolphin population by feeding them fish. There is of course, only one natural response to such provocation.</Text>
  <Text ID="3689">Alonso is looking for strong swimmers among the new recruits, and would you like to put them  through their paces, with a little impromptu military scenario training. </Text>
  <Text ID="3879">You have found Alonso in extremely bad humour today. Though he seems to believe it is already too late, he hopes you can help cut out the weed that is empire from his locality.</Text>
  <Text ID="3881">The noise from a merchant ship seems to have interrupted Alonso's mediatations one too many times. He doesn't care that the cargo is for him, he just wants it destroyed. </Text>
  <Text ID="18472">Alonso has given you the opportunity to use a pirate flag, meaning you can attack anyone and they likely won't know it was you, and any peace treaty you have will be rendered meaningless.</Text>
  <Text ID="18484">Alonso wants you to let go and stop worrying about which ships you destroy, and why, The important thing is that you are destroying them. </Text>
  <Text ID="3179">Alonso has heard of sunken ship from the east bearing treasures and goods of interest to him, and would like you to fetch them.</Text>
  <Text ID="3180">Alonso compares a royal frigate that has run aground nearby, to a fallen stag, and wishes to waste no time in stripping it of its best military assets.</Text>
  <Text ID="3834">Alonso's decision to place mines in the locality seems to have paid off. He asks you to help him make an assessment as to what remains of the enemy.</Text>
  <Text ID="3843">Alonso hopes you will recover some travellers who have wandered off the beaten track. They are sure to prove useful to him...one way or another...</Text>
  <Text ID="4116">Alonso is concerned for some diplomats of Her Majesty who somehow shipwrecked nearby, and hopes you can lift them to the warm safety of the rescue vessel he has provided.</Text>
  <Text ID="17073">"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text>
  <Text ID="4105">Alonso wants to know how good your instincts are for ambush. He is going to lie patiently in wait, and you are going to try and defend a ship of civilians from when he pounces.</Text>
  <Text ID="4114">Alonso secretly likes having such a powerful battleship and wants you to accompany him on a little mission to see exactly how all-conquering it really is.</Text>
  <Text ID="18486">Alonso would like you to take some of the younger generation on a boat trip through dangerous waters, believing that it will do them good to know the truth about what they are up against.</Text>
  <Text ID="18495">Alonso would like you to deliver a small token of his affections to the latest woman he has become infatuated with.</Text>
  <Text ID="18496">Alonso has asked you to deliver a feast to his waiting guests, who are waiting to hear what has happened to their countrymen.</Text>
  <Text ID="18497">Alonso is sending you around the houses to spread a message of fear, but insists it must be done quickly or the whole thing will be a disappointment.</Text>
  <Text ID="18498">Alonso would like you to smuggle a surprise into Gasparov's city as a reminder of the impermanence of our species' existence and legacy.</Text>
  <Text ID="18499">Alonso would like you to deliver some compensation to a woman in the area, whose husband appears to have met with injury whilst working at the factory.</Text>
  <Text ID="18514">Alonso would like you to take a picture of Bente's zoo for him to give to her as a gift, so that she knows he is there for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="18515">Alonso has set your harbour on fire so that you have some burning news to share in your morning papers. He wants you to be the reporter first to the scene and photograph the destruction.</Text>
  <Text ID="18518">Alonso offers you one of his unwanted playthings to collect, which no longer gives him quite as much pleasure as it did at first.</Text>
  <Text ID="18520">Alonso Graves, a former soldier in the imperial army, has asked you to collect a secret weapon from him to be used on his former masters. He hopes it will serve to remind the Queen and her followers they must live with the consequences of their wars overseas.</Text>
  <Text ID="18521">After the Great purge, Alonso asks you to bring him some wood to help him set a church bonfire. He believes bathing in its light will help cleanse any feelings of ill will among his people, and to realise this difficult act was all for the greater good.</Text>
  <Text ID="18524">Alonso asks you to decide which lion to feed a La Corona spy he has caught; Jean La Fortune or Isabel Sarmento. You get the feeling he wants you to intercede more generally in matters of morality, since he himself has no point of reference.  </Text>
  <Text ID="18525">Alonso asks your advice once more in deciding which of his long-serving disciples finally deserves to be 'freed'. To be perfectly honest, the outlook looks bleak for both...  </Text>
  <Text ID="18526">Alonso asks you to make another moral choice. Do you save the goodly priest or the trio of convicts?</Text>
  <Text ID="18527">In this final episode of his moral meandering, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour. He asks you to decide whether to risk allowing it to fester, or to rashly blow it away with the dynamite he is providing. Better brace yourself either way...</Text>

  <Text ID="18529">Alonso invites you to collect the legal fees he feels he owes you.</Text>
  <Text ID="16877">I need more brick. I build the mazes with brick, you see, so my little blind mice can bump their way around, like a big game of blind man's buff, but in many respects, more entertaining.</Text>
  <Text ID="16876">They must have more of the holy balm. I cannot be the scrying portal, the mirror to the other realm, when the pupils in the heads are not lost to a blackness of the void, their bodies limp and servile.</Text>
  <Text ID="16878">I need some cattle. Do you ever consult haruspices? You really should. You can learn an awful lot. Sadly, I'm still a novice. I find myself sifting through many animals, before I even begin to see the truth emerge.</Text>
  <Text ID="16880">Please, I must cleanse myself, for all our sakes, in the uncorrupted essence of animal. When you read about what liquids swilled about in the bathtubs of the ancients, you realise bath time could be so much more fulfilling!</Text>
  <Text ID="16881">If I give my men bicycles, can they escape starving tigers? It's a test you see, man versus nature. Science versus the universal. Of course you'd be more than welcome to join us, but first I need those bicycles.</Text>
  <Text ID="16882">If you watch a monkey opening a coconut, the whole thing seems so natural, so effortless. Give a coconut to Queen of half the world, and she has absolutely no clue. My men are the same. You better bring some dynamite. </Text>
  <Text ID="16883">If it's true what they say, and we are what we eat, I don't think my disciples are eating properly. Bring me texture, bring me body. Bring me something to get their juices flowing...</Text>
  <Text ID="16884">"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text>
  <Text ID="18467">Champagne is a guilty pleasure. A sin for a man like me, who is always so quick to reject anything that reeks of 'civilised'. But I 'm sorry, it tastes wonderful. I can't resist it, all those tiny bubbles tickling my tonsils!</Text>
  <Text ID="16897">You are a crouching fox. An infant rabbit flops into your clearing of peril. It's eyes are wide, but blinded by fear. It runs, you pounce, and you wring its neck. That's if the mama and papa rabbits don't catch your scent first...</Text>
  <Text ID="16900">I have found two rutting stags, two rivals who must long to be my mate! I want you to stab their haunches and make their passions race!</Text>
  <Text ID="16901">Destroy me. Burn me. Each scar the cruel, licentious blister that is man. Drown me. I long to swim up from below, an vision appalling yet pure, like the thorny creatures of beelzebub!</Text>
  <Text ID="16902">Look at those dolphins cavorting behind their boat, bellies stuffed full of fish they should have been catching themselves. Working together to beat them up from the sea bed with their tails. We are a corruption! A plague! We must all be destroyed.</Text>
  <Text ID="16903">In time, the sea and smoke will rise. Dreams of Atlantis will dash on the rocks. Just man killing fellow man until the sea washes over their heads. So— I need you to gather the ones who float, the rest are pointless.</Text>
  <Text ID="16904">We could have reached upward like honeysuckle, opened in perfect uniformity like a fragrant meadow of hibiscus, but instead we grew into foul weeds, just dying to be severed at the root! </Text>
  <Text ID="16905">Their clocks scream in my mind. Foghorns, pigcrap hawkers. Crumple these trader automata, their schedules will shatter my visions no more.</Text>
  <Text ID="18483">Here's a pirate flag for your ship. I know you long to kill anonymously and with impunity, so I'm just making the whole thing easier for you. Don't you see, nobody will know it was you! Hahahahaha. You are free! Hahahahaaha!</Text>
  <Text ID="18485">Maybe they are good people, maybe they are bad people. What does it matter? I know it is a difficult idea for you to swallow, but once they are dead, it really doesn't matter which side they were on. </Text>
  <Text ID="19905">Wow. I didn't see that coming.</Text>
  <Text ID="16906">A ship from the east. The tea leaves say it is sunk. There is powdered bone of tiger and milk of poppy aboard that will be great servants to me, and I would be grateful if you would gather them.  </Text>
  <Text ID="16907">When a mighty stag falls, who for many years had been warden of his forest, it cannot be more than five minutes before some resourceful insect wanders by, and realising what rich meat lines the carcass, plunges in his proboscis.</Text>
  <Text ID="16908">It sounds like those sea mines have exploded, and I could use some help. Do you like to count? Most people like to count, it's reassuring— our coins, our friends. So come, don't be shy, help me count those bodies.</Text>
  <Text ID="16909">I hear the bleating of sheep nearby, who find themselves...quite lost. I would gladly welcome them over the temple threshold. We can sit them down, give them jasmine tea, and talk about all the different possibilities that might await them here. </Text>
  <Text ID="16910">Those poor drowning creatures. I just want them to have some hope of rescue that's all, if only for a moment. Perhaps you can be the one to save them from a fight for their lives?</Text>
  <Text ID="17074">"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall."</Text>
  <Text ID="16911">Why don't we play a game? A ship of innocents is coming this way, and I am going to assault it. You will be their saviour, the guard of honour to shield them from my savagery! </Text>
  <Text ID="16912">An impregnable fortress they call my battle crusier; unsinkable! Ah the hubris of man, there is no string in this universe that will not unravel, no star that will not one day die. Nothing can stop the end.</Text>
  <Text ID="18490">There comes a time in every young boy or girl's life that they must come to terms with the world in which they have been cruelly abandoned. To see first-hand the crimes committed in faraway lands in the righteous name of empire. Perhaps you can break the bad news?</Text>
  <Text ID="18500">I have sighted a woman of great bosom and beauty, one whose arching red soul bridges to mine across a chasm of leeching decay. I feel the need to tell her how I feel, to show her how my heart beats for her! </Text>
  <Text ID="18501">Hello pigcrap. I would like you to offer up a dish of morsels and goblets of claret to some guests of mine. They were hoping to hear what unhappy fate has befallen their compatriots, and I feel obliged to let them know.</Text>
  <Text ID="18502">You always seem busy, pigcrap. So much to do, so little time! Well I have something to keep you on your toes...</Text>
  <Text ID="18503">Perhaps you can remind Artur of a matter we once spoke upon. I tried to explain the futility of 'legacy', you see. That all we are, all we create— will turn to dust. But for some reason, he seemed quite afraid at the idea. In my opinion, the man needs his head examined. Hahahahaha. </Text>
  <Text ID="18504">I owe someone an apology. I have been taking care of her husband for months now you see, but yesterday unfortunately, I was forced to let him go. You will be there to remind her however, that the news is only half-bad. </Text>
  <Text ID="18506">What!? This food ...WHAT IS THIS HORROR?! You mock us sirrah! Prepare to meet thine end!</Text>
  <Text ID="18507">I need these delivered while they are still hot, you see. They'll remind my old friends I am alive and well, just hiding under the bed, ready to RATTLE. Watch out though, the people I took those from probably want them back...</Text>
  <Text ID="18508">From Graves? What could it... NO! William! Please no, not my William! What... inhuman monster would send only his torso?! </Text>
  <Text ID="18516">Dear Bente loves her zoo. I often watch her through the bars, the way she floats among her gentle creatures, a sparkle of curiosity in the eyes. There must be some way to show her I am no different. I am a wild and savage beast that must be tamed!</Text>
  <Text ID="18517">Isn't it dreary when you open your newspaper in the morning, and there is no disturbing headline, no affirmation of all the chaos you know is bubbling under the surface? Well good journalistsn always sniff out a story! Better hurry to your harbour, hahaha!</Text>
  <Text ID="18519">At first it was a toy to give me thrills, but I soon grew bored. Maybe I don't have the patience, but you look as though you need cheering up. So come and get it!</Text>
  <Text ID="18522">The Empire sent me to hell, and I came back different. I was stretched within an inch of my life, saw lifelong friends turning over fire like thanksgiving turkeys, and what for? What for?! I want them to feel as I felt. To feel their lungs fill with char, to witness their towers of Babel crumbling all around them.</Text>
  <Text ID="18523">Now we have purged the earth of wickedness, we must make a bonfire, purify ourselves. This is not a petty vendetta. This is a realisation, for all mankind, that we are doomed, and I don't want that on my conscience.</Text>
  <Text ID="18531">What is right and wrong? Does anybody know? Out here in the sticks, you lose all sense. Anyway... I caught a La Corona spy, your honour. Should he dangle for Isabel, or for Jean?</Text>
  <Text ID="18532">Interesting interpretation; but I don't judge. Now, if I may beg further counsel.. Two of my disciples wish to be free, after many fine years of service, but I'm afraid I can only save one of them. The decision is too painful for me, so I better leave it to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="18533">I know, I know. It's so hard to live with the choices we make isn't it? Say there was a wonderful, wonderful priest, and three wicked, terrible, bad prisoners drowning, and you had to choose, which would you bring me to be saved?</Text>
  <Text ID="18535">It's difficult isn't, but I think you made the right choice. The perfect fuel for those cruel winter nights you get in the old world! Ha.Ha.Ha. One FINAL thing. When the black death descends, do you let it play out, or purge it with a great fire?</Text>
  <Text ID="18536">I have a small gift to thank you for your guidance at this difficult time. So much is going on inside my cranium, I sometimes think it might suddenly POP! </Text>
  <Text ID="21480">&lt;b&gt;EITHER:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up and rescue &lt;b&gt;the pastor&lt;/b&gt;</Text>

  <Text ID="13793">Vicente wants lots of bread delivered to help prepare his troops for a cold trip north, no doubt as part of some ambitious Imperial campaign.</Text>
  <Text ID="13794">Vicente asks you to deliver him weapons,  outlining the important advantages of weaponry over words in the immediacy of battle.   </Text>
  <Text ID="13797">Vicente is after advanced weapons to help modernise his navy, you better hope if you provide them, his fleet won't wash up on your shores...</Text>
  <Text ID="18048">Vicente's battalion has been awarded a medal by the King of La Corona, unfortunately due to the ongoing war effort at home, they could not afford to manufacture the medals to present them. Disgusted, Vicente asks you to bring the materials so that he can pin them on his men himself.</Text>
  <Text ID="13801">Silva has enlisted your help to thin the number of vessels available to the rebels in the New World, which are trying to break away from his beloved La Corona and other Old World empires.</Text>
  <Text ID="13805">Vicente wants you to perform a pre-emptive strike on one of the many enemies he seems to have made among the rebels of La Corona.</Text>
  <Text ID="13806">Silva has studied the enemy fleet and believes one boat is full of gunpowder. Destroying that should make short work of the rest. </Text>
  <Text ID="18050">King Alfonso, Vicente's superior and La Corona's head-of-state, is angry that the Queen is hogging the best fish and fishing grounds. Vicente has asked you, as a neutral, to sink a merchant vessel in the sound where the so-called poachers are most often spotted. He needs proof to take back to the King.</Text>
  <Text ID="18051">Vicente wants to enlist you as a mercenary to fight in the wars against the rebels trying to break away from the Old World Empire of La Corona that Vicente ostensibly serves. From Vicente's tone, this seems to be a critical coming together, so you ought to be well-prepared.</Text>
  <Text ID="18052">Vicente wants you to look for the rebel commander, who was not counted among the dead in a recent battle, and whom he therefore believes may still be hiding in the sea where the batlle took place. If you find him alive, there can be only one course of action.</Text>
  <Text ID="18053">Vicente wants you to destroy a small trade ship containing street urchins he knows have stolen from him, even though the spoils of war they stole have already been moved on to one higher up the chain. Vicente seems to have given up on tracing this mastermind, and is content for you to take it out on those immediately responsible.</Text>
  <Text ID="18054">Vicente has given you the great honour of going into battle first. The aim;  to destroy at least some of the enemy fleet, so that he can pick off the rest with ease.</Text>
  <Text ID="18055">Vicente wants you to track down some deserters of La Corona, it seems he has a zero tolerance policy to those who try to escape active duty, and intends to have them lined up and shot.</Text>
  <Text ID="18091">Vicente has suffered a humiliating defeat, and would like you to recover anything you can from the battlefield. It is his belief, that like with pastry, if at first you don't succeed, gather your scraps together and try and roll the whole thing out afresh.</Text>
  <Text ID="18093">Find the commander whose men mutinied against him, and bring him before Vicente Silva. Vicente believes having the commander watching his men pay penalty for insubordination may help in his natural development as a leader.</Text>
  <Text ID="13807">Vicente wants you to join him at sea, to demonstrate the hidden threats to which those in  positions of power are always exposed.</Text>
  <Text ID="18116">Vicente is paranoid about the activities of Lady Margaret Hunt, who he believes is meddling in his business more than ever. You are to provide escort for three of his ships bearing armaments, and report anything that might connect an attack with Hunt back to him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18117">Vicente wants you to escort his fleet into position undamaged, so that they are in tip-top condition for a pitched battle with yet more rebels of La Corona</Text>
  <Text ID="13809">Silva complains that his haughty little nephew is paying him a visit, and that the boy's mother, his extremely wealthy sister, wants him nannied at all times, in the hope it will improve his appalling behaviour.</Text>
  <Text ID="13812">Vicente has given in to the kidnapper's demands so that they will release his nephew Nicolau, who went missing in your care. Once the exchange has been made, Vicente expects you to get his money straight back.</Text>
  <Text ID="13813">Silva wishes to conclude a secret alliance with an eastern princess, and would like you to guarantee her safety en route to the diplomatic chamber.</Text>
  <Text ID="13814">Vicente has identified the spy responsible for messing up his deal with an eastern Princess, that had seemed so promising. He wants you to apply the maximum punishment.</Text>
  <Text ID="13965">Vicente sees no reason that pirates should continue to exist, and tasks you with exterminating them once and for all.</Text>
  <Text ID="13966">Noticing that the menace still remains, the bigot Vicente suggests destroying a few more ships to prevent any further pirate resurgence under the flag of Anne Harlow. </Text>
  <Text ID="13967">Vicente wants you to conquer Anne Harlow's island, eliminating the pirate threat to La Corona once and for all.  </Text>
  <Text ID="16800">It appears Vicente has his eyes on La Fortune's territory for La Corona, now that the Queen and her allies seem unable to contain his people's struggle for independence. Vicente suggests you lay a minefield as an opening gambit. </Text>
  <Text ID="16801">Vicente wants you to capitalise on the success of the minefield you laid and destroy what small defences Jean has, with a view to conquering his island in the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="16802">Vicente is greedy with anticipation at your possible victory over his adversary Jean La Fortune. Of course, if you are feeling even slightly regretful at this collaboration, there is always another way...</Text>
  <Text ID="16807">Vicente Silva has offered you a chance at a role in his life's work, the restoration of Isabel Sarmento's New World territories to La Corona, a crumbling Old World empire. To begin with, he hopes you can cut off a rebel supply line.</Text>
  <Text ID="16808">Vicente has roped you in again for the second part of his master plan to recover the rebellious colonies of La Corona. This time he wants you to skirmish with Sarmento so he can paint her as the warmonger in his newspapers.</Text>
  <Text ID="16809">Vicente would like to involve you in the next phase of his battle to subdue Isabel Sarmento's independence movement. He is building a fleet, and wants your contribution to it. </Text>
  <Text ID="16810">Vicente insists now is the time to strike the final blow against Isabel's rebellion. Or at least, this part of it. You notice he is committing most of his fleet to this end, perhaps he has unwittingly shown you the gap in his armour!</Text>
  <Text ID="17439">Isabel curses Vicente's allies (whoops that means you!) but has suggested that while Vicente's head is turned, there may be a chance he has left his home relatively undefended and open to attack.</Text>
  <Text ID="18184">Vicente would like you to deliver an alliance proposal to Bente Jorgensen on his behalf. Judging by his attitude, it seems unlikely even Bente would accept...</Text>
  <Text ID="18185">The rather oppressive Vicente Silva has asked you to deliver weapons to Bente Jorgensen to indicate his supposedly good intentions towards her. You doubt it will be a gift she is happy to receive.</Text>
  <Text ID="18236">Vicente believes he has found a natural nemesis in Alonso Graves, a man who has done what no soldier should do, and gone against his country. Vicente is rather thrown by Alonso's unpredictable nature however, and hopes you can deliver a message to bait him out into the open.</Text>
  <Text ID="18237">Sadly, it is Vicente who has never turned to face the light. To shake the confines of his human ignorance. To feel his face burn with the intensity of his own disgust, and emerge, on the other side, a free man.</Text>
  <Text ID="18090">Vicente is an avid reader, although naturally preoccupied by the subject of war. He has heard in the officer's mess, of a new book written in your language about the art of war, and wishes for you to bring it to him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18092">Vicente has no time for love among the ranks, and is rather irritated to discover the surveillance information he is waiting for has been delayed for a lovers' tryst. He can't face the tedious lovebirds himself, so he asks you to extract it from them instead.</Text>
  <Text ID="18139">Vicente wants you to scout ahead and photograph the rebel fleet in formation, believing this will enable him to develop a counter strategy.</Text>
  <Text ID="18162">Vicente is regretting his decision to ally with you, noticing that you have a tiny fleet size. He suggests you hurry up and build two frigates or he might have to think twice about the arrangement.</Text>
  <Text ID="18164">Vicente is mildly disappointed to discover you aren't much of an ally with the lack of weapons factories at your disposal. He suggests you do something about it, or the alliance between you could come to an abrupt end.</Text>
  <Text ID="16739">Not everywhere can a passing army pillage local villages for food and supplies, no! In the white expanses of the world, my men are going to march on bread.</Text>
  <Text ID="16740">I have every sort of pen you can imagine, quill, stylographic, underwater, gold-iridium-nibbed and I guarantee you not one of said writing implements are mightier than a sword in close quarters combat!</Text>
  <Text ID="16741">The threat my armada pose should be absolutely transparent to the enemy! They are already a spine-tingling spectacle, all they need now is an even deadlier sting!</Text>
  <Text ID="18049">A medal, the king said, for services to La Corona. Well...I see no sign of it yet, and I know why. The empire doesn't have enough metal to equip the army, that's why. Never mind us war heroes, flogging this dead horse of an empire. It's an insult! Bring me some metal, we'll mint the damn medals ourselves!</Text>
  <Text ID="16742">Now may not be the right time for a full-scale assault on the rebels in the colonies, but a gradual suffocation of the arms at their disposal shall serve me well for when that great day comes. Get to it soldier!</Text>
  <Text ID="16743">They'll never expect it! General Silva NEVER strikes out of the blue those mindless rebels will say, but I can be spontaneous, I can be!</Text>
  <Text ID="16744">One of the ships in the rebel supply convoy is shielded by the others. I smell powder, lots of it! If you destroy that ship you'll blow the rest to kingdom come! </Text>
  <Text ID="18056">La Corona is losing on every front, but what is King Alfonso's biggest concern? Fish. He likes eating fish, and the fishermen of the Queen keep drifting closer and closer to our waters. Of course, it makes no sense for me to start a war over it, what a crazy idea. You start it. And bring proof. </Text>
  <Text ID="18057">There is going to be a small skirmish. It's unavoidable but very winnable. If you were to take part, as a mercenary of course, it might give us the extra edge over those pathetic rebels. Of course you are a mercenary, you probably don't cae who you kill, so it may as well be for La Corona! </Text>
  <Text ID="18058">Well, we put them to the sword of course, and the waters coursed with blood and splintered timber, all of which made finding the enemy commander all the more difficult. But if he is not among the dead, the clever fellow must still be hiding out there, at the site of the battle! Execute him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18059">I have had the entire hoard from the battle of Cape Chance stolen from me by some devil-spawn adolescents and given to whoever their gutter-born fagin is. Needless to say, it won't be happening again! If they're old enough to steal, they're old enough to suffer for it. Go and make them suffer!</Text>
  <Text ID="18061">There's more than one way to skin a cat. Young boys go in full of bravado, climbing over the trench walls with the ephemeral spirit of life aflutter in their breast, knowing this will be all or nothing. Those of higher rank stand a safe distance away and pick off what remains of the enemy, before returning to their bunker for coffee and pastries.</Text>
  <Text ID="18063">You know what I do to deserters? I do the kindest thing it is in my power to do, I have them executed. What kind of life awaits them otherwise? Knowing they have failed their family and friends. Failing to defend the nation they swore to defend, failing at being real men. Yes, better bring them back here, hadn't you.</Text>
  <Text ID="18086">Didn't think he'd attack if he saw me little regulars on board! Lucky they're good swimmers. I've underestimated that Vicente, he's almost as heartless as I am. Hah! Only joking. He's a softie compared to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="18095">Sometimes when you take your big rolling pin, hnngh, and you roll out your pastry, it starts to crack up, hnggh. Bits...falling, on the floor. Hnngh. But you can't let that beat you No! You have to pick up the pastry, SQUISH it up into a great big ball once more, and roll the blasted thing out again! HNNGH. Hnnggh. Hnggh.</Text>
  <Text ID="18097">Mutiny, that's what it is! Unheard of! Hnnghh. Hnggh. One of my most subservient commanders, tossed into the sea by his own men. Find him, and bring him back here. I want him to be there for the court marshal and subsequent execution of his men, so he can witness how his weak leadership has caused this whole fiasco!</Text>
  <Text ID="16746">Seek power do you? It's better left to those born to it, who understand the danger that follows it about. Come with me, let me show you what I mean.</Text>
  <Text ID="18118">The old lady plots against me, I'm sure of it! My last three shipments of weapons were destroyed the moment they were round the bay. This time, you will be there to escort them, and you are to report any, ANY suggestion that Margaret Hunt was involved.</Text>
  <Text ID="18119">I know they can more than handle themselves, but my fleet are too busy and too important to be distracted by enemy outriders. That's where the grunts like you come in and take one for the team. Now, hurry, for the hour of triumph is near!</Text>
  <Text ID="16747">I tricked you into sending your fleet to the edge of the world, and leaving all of your territories vulnerable to assault. How does it feel, now the horse hair has snapped, and the sword is falling upon you?</Text>
  <Text ID="16748">The greatest horror I know— my nephew Nicolau, is visiting again, and I just can't face him. Please take him off somewhere, I don't care where, and for goodness' sake keep him on a leash or my sister will throttle me! </Text>
  <Text ID="16749">Kidnapped?! What!? No!!! I shall have to waste  energy and resources negotiating his release, when I should be taking over the world! Grrrr!</Text>
  <Text ID="16750">I have paid...a substantial amount.. for Nicolau's release from the two idiots you let get their low-born hands on him. See that they never make it home. </Text>
  <Text ID="16751">As I understand it, the great empire of the east is as unequivocal on that matter of damn rebellion as La Corona, so it makes sense for us to unite. Escort her here, but keep her identity anonymous!</Text>
  <Text ID="16752">As much as I want to blame you, I have reason to believe my secret concord with our friends from the east was shared from within my own ranks. I guarantee whoever that spy was, will pay a very high price indeed.</Text>
  <Text ID="16753">Sure enough, the one responsible for the breakdown of that eastern promise left my capital at first light this morning. I want that spy hunted down and served the only sensible penalty.</Text>
  <Text ID="16754">No-one has need of privateers now, and frankly I found it so demeaning when La Corona employed them back in the glory days. In fact, I'm so sick at the sight of those toothless simpletons, I think I'll leave their demise to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="16755">Seems like you've unearthed a stubborn little pirate in this Harlow woman, haven't you? Still, she is a woman, so I don't suppose she'll put up much of a fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="16757">She's an impressive leader, I'll give her that. But since you've done half the job on her horde already, may as well go the whole way and erase the pirate scourge for good.</Text>
  <Text ID="16794">La Fortune may not be the enemy of La Corona, but since your Queen doesn't seem to be imposing her authority over her protectorates, you may as well accidentally lay a few mines— on her behalf of course!</Text>
  <Text ID="16795">So, that minefield worked to thin out Jean's already limited forces, now heehee *rubs hands together* we must destroy the better part of his fleet before the final assault of his island!</Text>
  <Text ID="16796">You have him in the jaws of victory! Clamp shut and the spoils will be mine— I mean, ours! Then we can telegraph Sir Archibald and let him know the bad news for poor little Queenie.</Text>
  <Text ID="17432">Don't side with that lizard! I mean you don't even have to care for our cause to see what a despot that man is, and oh what a terrible loser, you have to see it to believe!</Text>
  <Text ID="16803">I have no idea how the woman Sarmento has become the greatest adversary of La Corona, it is truly baffling. If you destroy her supply vessels, I will know you can be trusted to see the rest of my grand strategy for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="16804">The thing about Sarmento, is she positions herself as a peaceful stateswoman, when it is obvious she uses methods as violent as the rest of us. If you start a fracas, I will have my newspaper pin it on her!</Text>
  <Text ID="16805">You've impressed me enough in your loyalty so far, for me to divulge— in the strictest confidence— the next stage of the plan for Sarmento. Preparation! The first and last rule in strategy. Today we build the assault fleet!  </Text>
  <Text ID="16806">Now is the time, my young warrior! Throw your life on the line for La Corona, and all will be well. I myself have been somewhat daring too, sending all of my best ships to this crucial battle, but when you have made mincemeat of every threat in home waters, that is your privilege!  </Text>
  <Text ID="17438">Whoever secretly helps Vicente is a fool! We shook off the old lizard's grasp off long ago. In fact...with all his forces heading for us, he has left the door open at home— perhaps for someone as clever as you to sneak through!</Text>
  <Text ID="18175">I would like you to deliver this letter to Bente Jorgensen. A beautiful woman should always be accompanied by an upright chaperone, born of a noble family, ideally overseas, who can do the difficult job of thinking for them, advising best use of whatever small means they have.</Text>
  <Text ID="18176">Everyone knows Bente needs protecting. So why shouldn't I be the one to look after her? I am the best-equipped, after all. As they say, there's nothing a woman likes more than a man in uniform!</Text>
  <Text ID="18186">From Vicente? Oh how terrible! I mean, normally I welcome those extending the olive branch to be companions of mine. But he's just such an arse...</Text>
  <Text ID="18187">Yuck, yuck no, no! Get the repulsive things away from me! I have told Vicente a thousand times, I am a pacifist— although I'm starting to wonder if I should make him my exception. I sometimes really feel like booping him over the head with my brolly!</Text>
  <Text ID="18203">None have I wanted to beat more than Graves. That traitor to soldiering— for which master it matters not—  tampers with the basic principles on which we are founded; the pyramid of society from highest to lowest. I want you to lure him into the open, send a barge up the river to his heart of sin.</Text>
  <Text ID="18225">So Vicente wants to beat us out of the trees. Like his drab pheasants falling limp into the brush at his estate. No, that's not good. Please, destroy his ship and return it to him. I have no lust to be part of his petty pantomimes. </Text>
  <Text ID="18235">Hnggh. A coward, and no surprise! It was cowardice that drove him into hiding, and until the day he is ready to face his crimes against the good name of soldiering, a coward he will remain! </Text>
  <Text ID="18094">We learn the basics from an early age, if we want to command. We attend fine military academies, we read all there is to read. Only then do we have the field upon which to pitch the tent of strategy. Find me a copy of "Leadership after Nadasky," and help me take the high ground.</Text>
  <Text ID="18096">Good soldiers too often find themselves distracted by the opposite sex. Those two lovelorn bores have been withholding surveillance information which is vital to the final victory of La Corona, I need you to put the two pieces of the puzzle together!</Text>
  <Text ID="18152">War feeds science, and science feeds war. Let us make use of the latest fad for photography, and capture the enemy formation in situ, for reconnaissance is a key part of good strategy, if I know how the enemy have delpoyed themselves, I will know almost immediately how to crush them!</Text>
  <Text ID="18170">Every day, I ask myself, what is the point of our alliance? Your fleet is pathetic! If I had known I'd be joined at the hip to a loser, I'd never have signed! Now buck up your ideas, or I shall rapidly withdraw from this misguided arrangement.</Text>
  <Text ID="18171">At no point when signing our alliance did you volunteer the fact you have not a single weapons manufactory in your possession! What kind of namby-pamby, lettuce-luncher are you?! Cobble something together at once, or I shall tear our alliance into ticker tape, and sprinkle it over your yellow jelly custard!</Text>

  <Text ID="17187">A noose was loose and the deck-licker feel asleep on guard, damned slacker. A schooner drifted away into open sea. Fetch it, dog, while I nail this one's eyelids to his temples.</Text>

  <Text ID="17120">Must be nice pirating in warmer waters, away from the Empire's grim tentacles. Me and me boys could take La Fortune's any day of the week. Show me their island, oi, I'll laugh meself to tears!</Text>
  <Text ID="17122">Having a big name is not exactly good on the smuggling bussiness, let me tell you. Keeps me on my toes. But I've come up with a creative solution: you do it.</Text>
  <Text ID="17124">That dog Mary, only she could pull a trick such as pretending to be with child to escape the gallows. We'll take her out of prison before they notice that's just a beer belly. Better yet: you will.</Text>
  <Text ID="17126">I know, I just know there must still be records of what happened to my father buried under the Queen's pet nose. Go there, find them, let nobody see you. Bring him back to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="17127">Yes! These people just had their tongues too busy with the bloody king's boots to speak up against my father's murder. Well, now... Oh, now Annie's got their names... Sir Ulbrecht Brawl... Let's go pay him a visit, shall we?</Text>
  <Text ID="17128">Next on the list is Christine Marble. She thinks she's safe on the other side of the world, but she's had it if she thinks an ocean's going to stop a Harlow's rage...</Text>
  <Text ID="17129">Air is lighter in my lungs now I don't share the world with those unscrupulous fazarts. But one still remains... Blake too watched as his king sentenced my father to the gallows on a whim. He too must pay. Take these flags as yours, he'll never know what hit them.</Text>
  <Text ID="17130">Oh, dear! Anne has attacked us before, but never like this! As sorry as I feel for her loss, she cannot continue to terrorise the good, innocent people of High Clarence Hall. I'm afraid the Queen is forced to intervene.</Text>
  <Text ID="17131">So this is it. Finally, we get the daughter's attention. She will die for her father's life as I lived for my father's death. You... you do understand, don't you? Fight by my side... friend.</Text>

  <Text ID="16587">La Fortune leaves no one behind. After learning that Eli Bleakworth has one of his crewmembers locked up, he has asked you to sail to Wormways Prison to bail them out whichever way you can.</Text>
  <Text ID="16588">Eli is willing to let you have Jean's crewmember, as long as you sink the fugitives ship and bring them back to him.</Text>

  <Text ID="16593">Etienne had sad news about Jean's mother, but his father was still under the same master when he left. He believes you will find information about him in the slave records, but they are very heavily guarded and sneaking past the patrols will not be easy.</Text>

  <Text ID="16634">Jean? Of course I remember the little rascal! I earnt my freedom years ago. His manman passed away, but his papa was still under the same master when I left. They keep the records well guarded, but they will lead you to him if you can get them.</Text>
  <Text ID="16635">These records... They are outdated, but there is a name: William Ward. It's a long shot, but my father might still be with him. I heard rumours of a slave ship near El Puerto. If you can take a picture, I can see if it is our man or not.</Text>

  <Text ID="17962">We are preparing to relocate the good people we managed to free from La Corona, but in the meantime, they all need clothes and food. Urgently.</Text>
  <Text ID="17963">Sometimes it feels like we're fighting an iron giant with stones and sticks. La Corona suffocates every chance we get at developing our own technology. Please, our engineers are more than capable, but we don't have the means to produce the required materials.</Text>
  <Text ID="18674">La Corona strangles our supply routes and burns our fields. We have more people than we can feed. If you have anything, anything you can spare, please, you would be saving many lives.</Text>
  <Text ID="18675">This revolution is sadly a violent one. We are always in need for more weapons. Help us arm our brothers and sisters against La Corona.</Text>
  <Text ID="17964">La Corona is a terrible enemy, but these particular individuals are exceptionally sadistic. It cannot wait, they must be destroyed before they lay a finger on another innocent.</Text>
  <Text ID="17965">There's a colonial fleet coming our way! This is the worst possible timing! Please, we cannot face them alone, help us sink their warships!</Text>
  <Text ID="17966">According to our intel, there's a smuggler delivering weapons to La Corona's forces. We cannot allow them to grow any stronger, cut their cords!</Text>
  <Text ID="17967">There have been some tensions between the members of the Movement lately. It's clear to me that this mysterious colonial ship is nothing but a poorly disguised trap, but some of my comrades are insisting we face them. I have no choice, if we want to keep the Movement united, we have to take the bait.</Text>
  <Text ID="17968">My comrades were captured by La Corona! Quick, find the ships and free them before they get away from our reach! I won't let anyone else fall into their hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="17969">Our last skirmish against La Corona was too close. We managed to sink their ship, but we were too badly beaten ourselves to stay on high seas a minute longer. We know they were carrying a substantial shipment that would be incredibly useful for us, we have to get it before they do!</Text>
  <Text ID="17970">I understand why everyone is on their toes, but we really need to be strong and resist La Corona's taunts... Ah... At least this time they survived... Could you go look for them, please?</Text>
  <Text ID="17971">I heard disturbing news from my family. They are in need of medical supplies which they are not getting. I have some ready, including a letter for them, and arranged a good friend who is willing to head there, but she cannot be seen near my harbour. </Text>
  <Text ID="17972">We are still awfully behind La Corona on our arms race. I heard one of their warships wrecked not far from here. Bring us their weapons so our engineers can try to replicate them.</Text>
  <Text ID="17973">Bente Jorgensen has her heart in the right place. When she heard about our struggle, she rushed to help us. I appreciate it, but I fear her harmless fleet could be an easy target for La Corona. Make sure she gets out of the region safely, please.</Text>
  <Text ID="17974">Your Queen and I share a mutual enemy, but it is in both of our interests that La Corona doesn't find out. An imperial ship is coming our way with supplies, but I fear La Corona might intercept them. Cover them, please!</Text>
  <Text ID="17975">I fear my spies may have been followed. Please, escort them safely to our island, we cannot afford to lose them nor the crucial information they learned about our enemy.</Text>
  <Text ID="17976">There isn't a single day I don't worry about all the civilians. We need to acquire new lands to relocate all the refugees away from this conflict. I arranged a deal over a distant island, but La Corona will not let our vessel leave these waters with the payment so easily...</Text>
  <Text ID="18680">Every day I receive new pleas for help from people who want to escape the yoke of La Corona. We have word of a group of civilians who managed to escape on board of a small ship, but they need protection to bypass their surveillance. Will you help us?</Text>
  <Text ID="17977">Jean and I have a different approach to this conflict, but we do share a common enemy. We would be having a much harder time if his people weren't pestering La Corona as much as they do. They too are having a hard time, I know he will appreciate some extra guns.</Text>
  <Text ID="17978">Some colonial scum is obstructing my trade routes, but I'm sure you would be able to get past them. I commanded my ships to drop their cargo at a designated position for you to pick up, I will give you the coordinates.</Text>
  <Text ID="18684">The poor people under La Corona don't even know of our existence. We need to let every single of them know that they have an alternative, that we are here to liberate them. Cover our Movement on your newspaper, please, we never know who might be reading.</Text>

  <Text ID="9546">Isabel has been alerted about a smuggler ship that is working for La Corona. She has asked you to take them down to sever their supply of weapons.</Text>
  <Text ID="9547">A mysterious colonial ship just appeared in Isabel's waters. While she sees right through La Corona's trap, she has no choice but to launch an attack to appease her comrades and prevent recent tensions from fracturing the Movement.</Text>
  <Text ID="9744">Some of Isabel's comrades have been captured by La Corona. She has pleade you to find them and free them from their captors before it's too late.</Text>
  <Text ID="9552">The Movement has it eyes on some crates that were left behind by one of La Corona's ships after a battle, Isabel has asked you to retrieve before they do.</Text>
  <Text ID="9553">Isabel tries her best to keep a cool head against La Corona, but some of her comrades find it harder to resist attacking their colonial enemies, even when the odds are clearly not in their favour. This once, things turned out well and, though they lost the ship, they were able to keep their lives. Isabel has requested you to go look for the castaways.</Text>
  <Text ID="9554">I heard disturbing news from my family. They are in need of medical supplies which they are not getting. I have some ready, including a letter for them, and arranged a good friend who is willing to head there, but she cannot be seen near my harbour. </Text>
  <Text ID="9555">The Movement's chances of winning against La Corona are slim unless they catch up with their arms race. Isabel would like you to recover the colonial advanced weapons to try and turn their design against them.</Text>
  <Text ID="9548">Bente Jorgensen rushed to help Isabel Sarmento the moment she heard about their problems, but her ships would not stand a chance against La Corona's, and Isabel worries she might be targeted if they find out she's helping them, so she has requested you to escort her safely back out of the region</Text>
  <Text ID="9549">The Movement's victory is also in the best interest of the Empire. The Queen is supporting Isabel in the war, but La Corona must never find out. Isabel has asked you to escort an imperial ship that's headed their way carrying valuable supplies.</Text>
  <Text ID="9745">Isabel is afraid for the lives of the spies she sent to gather information from La Corona. She has requested you to escort them to make sure they and their newly acquired knowledge arrive safely.</Text>
  <Text ID="9739">The Movement has a deal to acquire an island away from the region to relocate all the war refugees in a safe place, but Isabel knows La Corona is not going to make it so easy for them. She wants you to escort her ship carrying the payment.</Text>
  <Text ID="18678">Isabel Sarmento wakes up every day to a new difficult situation. A group of civilians have escaped La Corona on board of a small ship, but they need your help to arrive at El Puerto safe and sound.</Text>
  <Text ID="9541">As far as Isabel is concerned, Jean is better off well-armed against their common colonial enemy, which is why she wants to donate weapons to their cause.</Text>
  <Text ID="9556">La Corona has been blockading Isabel's trade routes. She needs you to pick up the supplies and smuggle them past the colonial patrols into her harbour.</Text>
  <Text ID="18686">The Movement's resistance is also a war on information. It is crucial for the good people living under colonial oppression to know who they are and what they do. Isabel has asked you to showcase her island on your newspaper to spread the word about them.</Text>

  <Text ID="3873">Eli is concerned as to the whereabouts of a high security prisoner, and would like you to find his transport ship and bring him in. Be careful though, he is supposed to be dangerous! </Text>
  <Text ID="3874">Eli is concerned that the Mssr. Philllippe, Inspector of Prisons, is not very popular at present, and will therefore need a capable escort if he is to make it to Wormways in one piece. </Text>

  <Text ID="17794">Maintaining social contacts and status is very important, something you will learn at some point. For this reason I don't want to disappoint an old client, although I don't do these things myself anymore. </Text>
  <Text ID="17795">Some corpses have the bad habit of not staying down. An old colleague will be in deep trouble if her client finds out she did not confirm the kill.</Text>
  <Text ID="17796">Normally I'd just feel bad for the poor devils, but these petty thieves sealed their fate the moment they thought Madame Kahina would be a fine target for their raids.</Text>
  <Text ID="17797">Coincidences are for the naive, and I plucked every remaining trace of naiveté out of me long ago. That flag brings many ugly memories, no innocent intention pushed their sails to these parts.</Text>
  <Text ID="17798">I might have been in it for the bussiness, but I never took a single life the world wasn't better off without. This one individual, though, is taking every job and asking no questions... I'd pay handsomely to see him be the next target.</Text>
  <Text ID="18538">Some cockroaches have crawled back from my past to try and blackmail me threatening to reveal my previous deeds to my customers, imagine being that naive. Send them a message for me, please: Madame Kahina cannot be intimidated.</Text>
  <Text ID="17799">I already engaged with business with Sheikh Suhail long ago, but let's refresh his memory with a little sample of Madame Kahina's curiosities.</Text>
  <Text ID="17800">I do not regret taking that man's life back when, but I did feel somewhat responsible for his wife and daughter, neither of them were to blame. From time to time, I arrange a small shipment for them. It brings comfort to my heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="17801">Are you looking for a stimulating task? I have something for you. One of my providers failed to load a specific request and I need you to come look for it. Thrilling, isn't it...?</Text>
  <Text ID="17802">Give them an inch, child, and they'll take a mile. I once helped an old colleague escape from a hairy situation she got herself into and now she acts like I'm her maid, here to pick up after her mess.Tsk... Look, just bring the dirt to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="17803">Do I look like a deliverywoman!? If they new the life of adventure I've lived, they'd never treat me like a runner of errands! Ahh, but if I want to keep my best customers...and if they need their purchases delivered to their ship...</Text>
  <Text ID="17804">I have always been a role-model citizen, so there is nothing to compensate for, but from time to time, I donate things I can miss so they end up with those needing them.</Text>
  <Text ID="17805">You develop kind of a sixth sense when you've been in a business like mine for as long as I did, and after a while you learn to trust your tinglings. Sail with me and let's hope I am wrong.</Text>
  <Text ID="17806">I have some demanding guests coming over, very important people from my past... I expect to be too busy to welcome them myself into the region, but I reckon they will be positively impressed by you.</Text>
  <Text ID="17807">My customers know they can only rely on Madame Kahina for their high demands, and some travel a long way  just to browse my stalls. I care very much about their safety...</Text>
  <Text ID="17808">Do not misunderstand me, child, I pride myself in the goods I provide, but they do tend to attract a... certain type of customer. The type that might try to hijack my trade ships if they don't see a cannon-brimming vessel around.</Text>
  <Text ID="17809">Poor Lord Gavin thought so highly of himself when he used a theoretical pirate attack as an excuse to finish his trading relationship with me. I offered him an escort, and guess who's buying again?</Text>
  <Text ID="18547">Loyal, reliable, efficient... and you don't ask many questions. It may be time to trust you with a different kind of task. I will give the coordinates of a ship. Be as a shadow, get there unseen. Bring me what you find.</Text>
  <Text ID="18548">Good. My agents did not even catch a whiff off you. Time for the real challenge. I'm meeting someone today. Follow them back, and make sure you are as invisible as you've been now.</Text>
  <Text ID="18549">So this is where they keep him... I must admit, you do seem to have a talent for discretion. The next, I warn you, is the most difficult task I will ask of you. I will answer all your questions, once our brother is free and alive by your side.</Text>
  <Text ID="18550">You have succeeded like few before you. Very well, I owe you the truth. I left those days behind me, but I am still a proud member of my organisation. We work to restore the balance between chaos and order. But they... They know we have Jacob, defeat them!</Text>
  <Text ID="18599">I told you, this 'associate' of yours is still safely stored behind bars. And I will not tolerate any more disconformities towards my management!</Text>
  <Text ID="18600">Your help has been invaluable. You may not yet realise it, but you have been key in restoring an ancient harmony of power and control. I will not endanger your life any more, but remember: nothing is true.</Text>

  <Text ID="9809">A clueless gang of bandits decided to raid one of Madame Kahina's ships. Little do they know it might have been the last thing they ever lay hands on.</Text>
  <Text ID="9810">Madame Kahina has recognised the flag waving over a ship that has arrived in the region, and she doesn't think they are up to any good.</Text>
  <Text ID="9811">Madame Kahina still holds her previous professional occupation in high regard. A new assassin is giving the trade a very bad name, she would like you to take care of him.</Text>
  <Text ID="18539">Some people Kahina used to know are trying to extort money from her waving the ocupations she chose in the past at her reputation. A foolish mistake, for they signed their sentence the moment the letter was delivered.</Text>
  <Text ID="9803">Madame Kahina would like you to bring Sheikh Suhail a present from her to make sure he remembers she is the finest trading partner around.</Text>
  <Text ID="9812">Madame Kahina still feels a bit responsible for the wife and daughter of one of her old targets. She would like you to make a small delivery to them.</Text>
  <Text ID="9813">Madame Kahina's life as a merchant is a lot simpler than what she was used to. From time to time, she comes across some very mundane inconveniences that still need resolving, even if they bore her to death.</Text>
  <Text ID="9814">Madame Kahina is fed up with having to look after an old sloppy protégée, but as much as she complains, she can't help but give her a hand. She has asked you to pick up all the evidence she left on the scene.</Text>
  <Text ID="9815">Madame Kahina prides herself in the excellent products she provides for her customers, but some of her customers demand special terms of delivery. And even though she hates to lower herself to that level, she has no choice but to comply to maintain her reputation.</Text>
  <Text ID="9816">I have always been a role-model citizen, so there is nothing to compensate for, but from time to time, I donate things I can miss so they end up with those needing them.</Text>
  <Text ID="9804">Madame Kahina has a bad feeling about today, she would feel a lot more reassured if you were to escort her transport in case something goes down.</Text>
  <Text ID="9817">Madame Kahina is expecting an extremely important visit. While she is busy preparing everything for their arrival, she has asked you to welcome them and escort them safely to her harbour.</Text>
  <Text ID="9818">Madame Kahina's customer are as special as her merchandise, and some come from very far away. She wants you to guarantee their safety on their way back.</Text>
  <Text ID="9819">Madame Kahina is fairly used to dealing with raiders by now. She understands the merchadise she transports is very tempting to certains audiences and would like you ensure it arrives safely.</Text>
  <Text ID="9820">Madame Kahina can see right through anyone. When a valuable customer tried to sever their trading relationship arguing that his ships might be attacked on the way, she quickly came back with an escort counteroffer.</Text>
  <Text ID="18541">Madame Kahina always aims for excellence. It has come to her attention that yours are the finest ships in the region and she would like to put one of your cargo ships to the test. If it meets the expectations to join her trade fleet, she might request more ships in the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="18542">Madame Kahina has seen something special in you, she believes you may be able to carry out something diferent to what she usually entrusts you with. She wants you to go to a ship unseen and bring back everything you find there, without asking any questions.</Text>
  <Text ID="18544">You passed Madame Kahina's test, and now she is ready to trust you with a real mission: you must follow her guest back and report everything you hear back to her.</Text>
  <Text ID="18545">You still don't know who that prisoner is to Madame Kahina, but she wants him free. Breaking a man out of Wormways Prison, though, is easier said than done. Expect heavy surveillance and a strong response once he's found to be missing.</Text>
  <Text ID="18546">Madame Kahina's explanations have been interrupted by an unforeseen fleet. You still don't fully understand why, but their attack must be stopped.</Text>

  <Text ID="17479">Shocking to hear rumours of dissidents nearby. Such a brazen threat to our inexperienced Queen. Play the patriot and stamp out the growing fire.</Text>
  <Text ID="18605">Oh, what heartless rumours to spread about a grieving widow and a most trusted member of Her Majesty's council. It would be but a favour to the world to strip them from their hearts completely.</Text>
  <Text ID="18606">You of all people must understand how difficult family matters can be. Even when decades apart, one cannot help but worry about the well-being of their kin. My poor niece will grow tired of playing pirates eventually. In the meantime, I'll slit the throat of anyone who dares cut her noble skin.</Text>
  <Text ID="18607">A band of shameless criminals stole away one of Her Majesty's vessels! You must be swift, child, who knows what mischief they could do under the royal flag!</Text>

  <Text ID="17481">Such a tragedy, our allies, struck at midnight by an invisible foe... Clean the remains of the wreckage, child, and bring them to me. I will see to it that the affairs of the deceased are rightly settled.</Text>
  <Text ID="17483">Oh, look at the poor travellers, stranded at sea, they must have been caught up in a storm! Bring them to me, child, I will warm them up.</Text>
  <Text ID="17485">Someone has disturbed my dear Benjamin's grave. Please, could you recover what of it remains intact? Meanwhile, I shall slowly mull over a fitting retort...</Text>
  <Text ID="17486">Her Majesty has nothing but kind words towards you, child. Since she commends you so passionately, I have decided to entrust you with the safety of my ship. Hopefully, she will extend her trust once she sees us sail together.</Text>
  <Text ID="17487">Some innocent merchants have had a bit of bother. Could you guide them to my harbour, where they will be quite safe?</Text>
  <Text ID="17488">Hunt wants the player to escort a scientist who just made a "great discovery", the greatest discovery. Really. She will be able to save humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is afraid others might want to stop this or steal the knowledge/ideas, so asks for an escort just in case (do we spawn attackers?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe royale attackers? Or is this too direct?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She portrays the mission as "for the good of humanity", can't imagine anyone wanting to interfere - then there are a lot of attackers, makes the player wonder if intentions are good.</Text>
  <Text ID="18619">As usual, I will be shipping my monthly donation for the New World. Unfortunately, we need and escort, since we have had troubles in the past. Hard to imagine what cool-blooded creatures would have the stomach to steal food and clothes meant for less fortunate children...</Text>
  <Text ID="18620">My dear guest got too infatuated with the Pinot Noir during our celebration in the honour of our beloved Baron Vismark. Take him away discreetly before he embarrasses himself any further, dear.</Text>
  <Text ID="18621">I organised an exhibition in the honour of my late husband, Gilbard Hunt, may the Lord rest his soul. He was very fond of snakes and had a great interest on the venomous species found on the New World rainforests. Now that the exhibition is over, they should be returned to their original habitat unharmed.</Text>
  <Text ID="18622">Come back here, you murderer! I will avenge Lord Vismark even if it costs me my life!</Text>
  <Text ID="17482">Everyone is in such a rush these days, a visiting ship forgot to load up their cargo at my harbour. But I do not forget. Wouldn't you be so kind as to return those crates to them? But be careful, those are dangerous waters.</Text>
  <Text ID="17484">Anne's piracy brings further shame upon our family, but she remains my niece. I cannot be seen to help her foolishness, but perhaps if you were to...</Text>
  <Text ID="18634">Ensuring the peace in the realm sometimes requires distasteful actions, like being involved with nasty characters such as Mr. Graves. Please, deliver this gift to his harbour in behalf of Her Majesty.</Text>
  <Text ID="18635">How can one make a move without knowing what colour are the pieces on the board? An unknown ship has recently docked at Madame Kahina's harbour. Bring me all the information you can gather about them.</Text>
  <Text ID="18636">I know we have had our differences in the past, child, but I still believe we can work together if we cast aside our differences. What do you say, would you do a simple delivery for an old lady?</Text>
  <Text ID="18637">I still pray for the day my niece gives up this buffoonery of piracy and comes back. Bring her a gift from her aunt, let her know my door is always open for her return.</Text>
  <Text ID="18638">It breaks my feeble heart that Sir Archibald could ever doubt the good work we do at The Promise Trust. Bring these letters of appeal to my fellow members of the council. Hopefully, they will understand.</Text>
  <Text ID="18639">I guess they need more persuasion! Can I trust you will see their needs fulfilled?! (maybe slightly annoyed, allthough not worried)</Text>
  <Text ID="18624">The Royal Council has been informed of a suspicious ship sailing on Her Majesty's waters. As a loyal servant of the Queen, I assume you will have no trouble in following and reporting everything you learn about this strange alien.</Text>
  <Text ID="18627">Isn't the royal residence on High Clarence Hall a building of the utmost beauty? It exudes tranquility. I would love to have a framed picture of it on my wall. I hear you have a special talent for photography. Would you mind, dear?</Text>
  <Text ID="18641">I must admit I underestimated you at first, child. You have potential, I'd say you could even become a suitable leader if you keep the right people around you. Here's a token of my appreciation, I hope you accept my apologies.</Text>
  <Text ID="18647">There is an event for the Royal Council approaching and I have heard of a wonderful recipe to spice up the beverages. Bring me these ingredients, child. </Text>
  <Text ID="18648">Oh, unfortunately my joints are giving me trouble again and I will not be able to attend the party. Still, make sure Sir Archibald receives my special champagne, I poured all my love into it.</Text>
  <Text ID="18652">I have gotten the most dreadful news! A shipment of beer that was suppossed to quench the thirst of my loyal crew was contaminated! You need to get rid of the deadly brew before it reaches them!</Text>
  <Text ID="18653">I am so relieved that they are safe. But they still need to wet their throats. Bring this new shipment of beer to them.</Text>
  <Text ID="20061">How unfortunate, it would seem we didn't quite get the formula right this time... A pity... Still, your name will be remembered, you helped The Promise Trust make great advances, child.</Text>
  <Text ID="18658">Everything is prepared for the big announcement. The Promise Trust is ready to publish the results of our long-running research on the flu. I presume you will take good care of our distinguished guests.</Text>
  <Text ID="18659">The announcement was a complete success. We are so close to finding a cure for the flu. All we need now are tests subjects that are kind enough to trust their lives to us. Would you spread the word around?</Text>
  <Text ID="18660">Marvelous, we have received an overwhelming response. There are many people ready to sail our way, please make sure they arrive safely.</Text>
  <Text ID="18661">The main researcher of The Promise Trust has just arrived at Madame Kahina's harbour, will you pick him up for me? We will also be needing a few more materials to finish this phase, I'm sure you will have no trouble gathering it.</Text>

  <Text ID="15426">Me poor auntie, God rest her soul, left this for me, but whatever would I want it for? I'm sure a cultured one like yerself would appreciate her legacy propper.</Text>
  <Text ID="15427">'Twas a day like any other, ploughing the field, when m'boy dug this thing up! You like these, don't ye? Don't worry, we already scrubbed it clean.</Text>
  <Text ID="15428">'Tatoes for dinner, 'tatoes for lunch, 'tatoes for breakfast... I'm so sick of potatoes, please rid us of the bloody stuff!</Text>
  <Text ID="15429">I caught this scamp gobbling all my fish up, but I couldn't bear to hurt it. Will you give him a home?</Text>
  <Text ID="15430">Huh, what a dimwit, he cannot put two words together! I need someone who is in my level, a man of the law... A police officer!</Text>
  <Text ID="15431">He is so serious! I would die of boredom with a man like that by my side! Don't you know someone who knows how to have fun? Maybe someone at the pub?</Text>
  <Text ID="15432">Oh, the stench, the depravity, no! You really don't get it, do you? He must be attractive and inteligent, fun yet a decent gentleman! A man of the world! Check the piers!</Text>
  <Text ID="15433">Look at those scrawny shoulders! He'll snip in half if he tries to lift two potatoes!</Text>
  <Text ID="15434">Haven't you seen those dead fish eyes? He gives me the creeps!</Text>
  <Text ID="15435">He couldn't tell his mother from a sheep!</Text>
  <Text ID="15436">Too fancy for my taste.</Text>
  <Text ID="15437">My pigs! Gov'nor, you need to help me. See, they've escaped their pen. They're all we got, please get them back!</Text>
  <Text ID="15438">Hubby's a terrific firefighter, but he has the habit of dissapearing after his shift. Last time they found'im passed out by the pub and I'm worried sick he might have fallen somewhere...</Text>
  <Text ID="15439">Gov'nor! Seen my child? Oh, that little rascal, always getting in trouble with that Spuds kid... If you find him, tell him he's going to be the death of me!</Text>
  <Text ID="15440">I swear there is no man in this whole town fit fer me! Look at me! My beauty does not compare to these peasants! You know everyone here, don't you? Find me an attractive husband, like a firefighter!</Text>
  <Text ID="15441">Ma vache! Elle est perdu! Find ma petite Antoinette, I beg of you, she surely doesn't know her way back home...!</Text>
  <Text ID="15442">Bloody hounds have the whole neighbourhood terrorised. Sooner or later a kid's going to end up bitten! Lock them away, ye must!</Text>
  <Text ID="15443">Damned wild animals are eating all my hens! Poor things are so terrified they haven't laid an egg in weeks. Please, gov'nor, catch the rascals!</Text>
  <Text ID="15444">Me pig's been stolen! It's one of the Willington lads I tell ye! See this big 'W' in the mud? Only their fancy boots leave prints like that!</Text>
  <Text ID="15445">Me livestock! Hubs made fun of me when I told him they were up to summat... They all ran away! Our living depends on them, find them, please!</Text>
  <Text ID="15446">Oh, how passionate and inspiring! Yes, I shall give this one a chance... For now.</Text>
  <Text ID="15447">Oi, heard they've sheep with looong necks on t'other side of the world. I'd kill to see one of those!</Text>
  <Text ID="15448">What a beautiful day for a wedding! Take one of them photographs for the happy couple at the church, will ye?</Text>
  <Text ID="15449">Me Dorothy and I have been preparing for this the whole year: the Cow Beauty Pageant! Or agricultural fair as the others like to call it... Document this wonderful event, yes?</Text>
  <Text ID="15450">Me child's a firefighters' fanatic! He wishes to join the local squad when he grows up. It'd mean the world to him if you could take a picture of the firestation to hang by his bedside.</Text>
  <Text ID="15451">Doctor's told me to stop carrying heavy buckets of water to and fro, but I've many mouths to feed! If only there was a fountain nearby...</Text>
  <Text ID="15452">There's been another accident with the tools we left laying around, someone's goint to get killed one day! Build a kiosk so we can store them safely, will you?</Text>
  <Text ID="15453">My father's too old to be ploughing the fields, but he refuses to stay home! A little shade to keep his head cool would go a long way, if you can spare a tree or two around here.</Text>
  <Text ID="15454">Us farmers have devouted our whole lowly life to harvesting, but none's ever tasted the long yellow fruit they grow in the New World! Wish we could try them at least once in our lifetime...</Text>
  <Text ID="15455">I once had a taste of that canned food artisans enjoy so much and loved it! I wish I were able to afford some of it if only for my wedding feast...</Text>
  <Text ID="15456">Neighbourhood had no time to prepare for the winter, and me ma's knee forecasts a specially wicked one this year. Have you some timber to spare for the fireplace...?</Text>
  <Text ID="15457">I went mushroom picking in the forest and met the most wonderful man, but we were so caught up in the moment that I forgot to ask his name! Do you think I might find him at the pub? Or maybe he's more of a club gentleman...?</Text>
  <Text ID="15458">I waited for hours, but he never came... I guess we were not meant to be... Still, thank you for caring, yer a true friend.</Text>
  <Text ID="15459">There he was, like you said! He was so happy to see me as well! We will remember your help, please take this with our thanks.</Text>
  <Text ID="15460">You know, Guv, I haven't had a thing to complaint about in weeks. Not feeling like meself, honestly. I would even like to give you a gift... What's happening to me?</Text>
  <Text ID="15461">We've so much, Guv, even me orphans are plump. Little Olly just this morning told me "Sir, can I not have some more?". Poor things gave me this for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="15462">Those dimwits, skipping our union meeting to drink the second I look away... My comrades need to hear my proposal! Lend me your authority to gather them up, Guv.</Text>
  <Text ID="15463">Me pals, they're so short, you see, they always lose their way to the mines. Good thing is we always make sure to move in a line. Help me find me pals before they miss their shift, yes?</Text>
  <Text ID="15464">Me boy's passionate about the worker's struggle! Maybe even too much. See, he's been handing leaflets to his school mates, refusing to "be oppressed by his bedtime".</Text>
  <Text ID="15465">It's always the same with Old Harold! We arranged our protest on the nineteenth, but out he goes on the ninth all on his own. His bad hearing is going to cost us our reputation! Please shut him up.</Text>
  <Text ID="15466">Could you point me the way to Ah Sing's house? He's got... good ways of making one forget about the hardships of work. It should be easy to spot by the- er... vapour.</Text>
  <Text ID="15467">Miss Alethea's concoctions can clear soot clogged lungs in a whim! She lives high up in the mountains tho, and this cough has me too feeble to climb meself...</Text>
  <Text ID="15469">We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig in our mine the whole day through!</Text>
  <Text ID="15470">To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig is what we really like to do!</Text>
  <Text ID="15471">It ain't no trick to get rich quick if you dig dig dig with a shovel or a pick.</Text>
  <Text ID="15472">In a mine! Where a million diamonds shine! We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig from early morn till night.</Text>
  <Text ID="15473">We dig up diamonds by the score! A thousand rubies, sometimes more!</Text>
  <Text ID="15474">But we don't know what we dig 'em for. We dig dig dig a-dig dig, heigh-ho! It's home from work we go.</Text>
  <Text ID="15475">How am I supposed to brag about punch club if I can't talk about punch club? Oh, I know! The rules didn't say anything about takings pictures...! Meet us at the market place.</Text>
  <Text ID="15476">Me mates and I have shared so many moments working at the brick factory... Jimmy's birthday is coming up and there would be no gift more perfect than a framed picture of the place that brought us together.</Text>
  <Text ID="15477">Can you believe!? Those pigs won't let us in on their precious club. We'll let them know what they can kiss, those... burgoise. You might want to have your camera ready!</Text>
  <Text ID="15479">All this smoke and soot takes a real tool on our bodies. My oldest, she's gotten sick as I've never seen her before. Don't we have a place we can take her to?</Text>
  <Text ID="15480">Our work clothes get stuck in the machines day in and day out. We spend our nights stitching every rip back together! Sure would be nice to have some of those fancy sewing machines...</Text>
  <Text ID="15481">These nuveau riche parading their luxuries around while most of us lowly workers have never tasted a single droplet of cocoa! Even things out, boss!</Text>
  <Text ID="15482">I just became a precious little girl's papa, Guv! We need something fancier to toast just this once, for my baby. You could get us some champagne, right?</Text>
  <Text ID="15483">The community could use some bonding. Help me organise a good old fashioned barbecue, yes? Just get the sausages and bread and I'll take care of the rest!</Text>
  <Text ID="15484">So... My mates wanted to see who's stronger and turns out I won, but... I may or may not need bricks to... rebuild something. Please?</Text>
  <Text ID="15485">Er, is this what champagne tastes like? I'll be sticking to beer then, thank you very much.</Text>
  <Text ID="15486">It would be wonderful if everyone in my cricle were clothed in soft natural fibres! Such timeless and modest garb, surely will be very little trouble to import!</Text>
  <Text ID="15487">Coffee! It must be how Engineers maintain such focus! If I too were worthy of these enchanted beans, I am sure, given time, I might filter the pre-eminent brew of our age! </Text>
  <Text ID="15488">Comic opera requires authenticity as much as any theatre, and the audience will jeer me if the pirates do not all swig rum for the duration...</Text>
  <Text ID="15489">Steam shall never supercede sail in the imagination! I envision canopies of sail above shell-lined walkways, seascapes, and mariner's paraphernalia...</Text>
  <Text ID="15490">Woe! I long for a bucolic life! Perhaps some rural farming family might take me in, and share the very precious simplicity of their lives with me?</Text>
  <Text ID="15491">Erwan Grogg is here! Touring incidental music he composed for a modernist masterwork! If I do not faint, please, I beseech you, will you introduce us? He is sure to be in front of the theatre!</Text>
  <Text ID="15492">When shes is not at church teaching the von Tripp children music, my daughter Maria goes singing and picking edelweiss in the hills. I do hate to interrupt her lessons with the children, but I need her here in the workshop. </Text>
  <Text ID="15493">In the pastry section— a genius. In a new city— a fruitcake! Can you help me find my cousin? He is a huge bold fellow who never parts from his beer, unmissable!</Text>
  <Text ID="15494">At the visitor harbour! Surely you have heard of Mr. Joseph Jefferson, tragedian nonpareil?! His brilliance merits the grandest of welcomes!</Text>
  <Text ID="15495">When I could not see his red chemise, I glanced up, and understood my apprentice had gone. He says he prefers to be his own boss and make money at the theater. There are more wealthy people there than at my little shop for sure ... (sigh) Perhaps I am no natural figure of authority.</Text>
  <Text ID="15497">Please! The first days may well test my resolve, but my heart is wild! It shall carry me through! </Text>
  <Text ID="15498">But I shan't be any burden, I shall be lighter than the country air! And for the dust, I can always wear gloves?</Text>
  <Text ID="15499">Oh thank you, thank you. Saved indeed, saved!... You don't imagine the labour will be too arduous, do you?</Text>
  <Text ID="15500">O, for a taste of distant shores and foreign lips and the elegant shadows of slender leaves...! Still, I cannot leave my earthly prison... To see that paradise, if only in a still picture, would take my breath away...</Text>
  <Text ID="15501">My precious Annabel is about to commence her lifelong voyage of learning! She will shine a light so bright on the world— I must have a picture of her with her fellow pupils!</Text>
  <Text ID="15502">Please, a photograph of us at the zoo! We may never again have the chance before our little Timothy succumbs to his illness.</Text>
  <Text ID="15503">The grand opening! Finally, grandfather's canning plan comes true! A picture will inspire my own grandchildren to preserve...ha!...the business forever...</Text>
  <Text ID="15504">Dubois would take my lovely Rebecca away, but I shall not let him! A photograph of the duel shall prove the lengths to which I am willing to go for her!</Text>
  <Text ID="15505">Seen all there is to see! And if the museum so ceases to stimulate, I am left with naught but my inner monologue, and little in life terrifies more than that!</Text>
  <Text ID="15506">This is one of my great favourites, I have long sought a like-minded soul with whom I might share it! </Text>
  <Text ID="15507">Ah, the turbulence of the past is never so dreadful as that of the present! Indeed, I find these ancient artefacts of war quite romantic, as I hope, you will also!</Text>
  <Text ID="15508">It is finally finished! My life's work in art. Dare I dream that by accepting this gift, you intend to make it a centrepiece for the world to admire?</Text>
  <Text ID="15509">It's my favourite time of the year again, the best craftsmen in town all gather for the annual artisan fair! Aren't you excited to greet them and contemplate their masterful work?</Text>
  <Text ID="16374">Ah, the hardships of the lowly life...! I... I don't think I am quite fit for this...! Please, take this for the loss of time.</Text>
  <Text ID="16135">These two men claim they are the best poets in the city! Please settle their argument, choose the one you prefer.</Text>
  <Text ID="16133">Roses are red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violets are blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onions stink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so do you.</Text>
  <Text ID="16134">My head is full of random stuff,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like rusty bread and bits of fluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And talking pies with googly eyes,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And stupid stuff that doesn't rhyme.</Text>
  <Text ID="15657">I really hope this final prototype will function as designed outside of a laboratory. Perhaps you would be willing to put it through its paces?</Text>
  <Text ID="15658">These seeds are the product of years of painstaking plant grafting in our botanical nurseries. This crop should now grow on your island as if in its natural climes!</Text>
  <Text ID="15659">It is far too common to see the poor suffer ill health— from smoking chimneys, or the miasma of the mines! It is the life's work of one of my esteemed peers. If you have a position available, I am sure they would work wonders!</Text>
  <Text ID="15662">Charles Darwin, one of the greatest minds of the century is in town! He has been conducting studies about evolution but some of his experience subjects have escaped and are running in the city. If you help him I am sure he would agree to work for you. Start with the fishes close to the harbour!</Text>
  <Text ID="16154">Great! That's the first animal of his experiment! Could you find his crocodiles now?</Text>
  <Text ID="16155">Wonderful! Just need the baboon and we are all set!</Text>
  <Text ID="16156">I just spoke to mister Darwin, he is thrilled to work with a patron so understanding as you. He agrees to move in the city!</Text>
  <Text ID="15660">All these children, sent to the factories as soon as they learn to walk! Such a pity! A child should have a chance to learn to read and acquire skills! Please, convince some workers parents that this is the best for their child, I am willing to teach them for free.</Text>
  <Text ID="16157">Mmh, I can send her my child but there is no way that I am feeding this useless mouth, she will have to take care of it as well! </Text>
  <Text ID="16158">What a wonderful opportunity! I wished I had the same when I was a child.</Text>
  <Text ID="16159">Leaning is the best way for my daughter to understand the pressure classes put on us and fight them effectively!</Text>
  <Text ID="16160">I do need the money my daughter brings by going to the factory but if this allow her to do better than me in life ...</Text>
  <Text ID="16161">Teaching to children? What a weird idea, mine learnt everything she had to know by living the real life! </Text>
  <Text ID="16162">What is she? Some kind of Jean Valjean? Fair enough, let her take care of my son but she better not complain when he will do his usual shenanigans.</Text>
  <Text ID="15661">I have been exchanging for months with a man who calls himself El Professor. He is so intelligent, he seems to always know what I am going to say before I even say it! And now he is coming in the city! I promised I would make him visit the bank. Could you pick him up?</Text>
  <Text ID="16163">Thank you! He loved the bank, he said he will visit it with friends of his soon!</Text>
  <Text ID="15664">People who keep exotic pets, and fail to care for them, seldom realise the damage they do to native animal populations! We must catch the invaders before they take hold!</Text>
  <Text ID="15665">Could you take the photograph, at the front of the University? My daughter has studied eleven hours each day, for five years for this moment!</Text>
  <Text ID="15666">Because I am a woman, many question if the breakthrough really is mine. As such, it gives me the greatest pleasure to be photographed beside the steam shipyard where my new engine will be used.</Text>
  <Text ID="15667">The workers presume I am too fancy to get my hands dirty. But I value field work greatly! A photograph of me visiting the steelworks shall prove it!</Text>
  <Text ID="15668">I wonder what would happen if we tried to photograph a train in motion? Exposure will likely make it a blur, a smudge, but why don't we conduct a little test!</Text>
  <Text ID="15671">I am hosting an academic symposium for my co-authors, and need to feed them all. Experts say fish is good for the brain— please deliver some to my home.</Text>
  <Text ID="16164">Seems we have no time to cook the fish, in part because we can't reach consensus on the best method. Perhaps you could bring some of the tinned stuff instead?</Text>
  <Text ID="15669">My sand-themed paper cannot propound a single unifying theory without the support of experimental evidence! I will need materials! </Text>
  <Text ID="15670">With so much still to be discover, we cannot afford to rest! If recent healthfulness researches are to be believed, my colleagues and I have little to fear from our coffee indulgences!</Text>
  <Text ID="15672">We are presently trying to teach chimps and bonobos to perform human tasks, and would like a fleet of bicycles to wheel them to the park on. Would you be able to help?</Text>
  <Text ID="15673">Most people still fear the light bulb! Think they'll be electrocuted if they touch one! Well, let's bring them out of the dark ages. Help me organise an eastern festival of light, with an undercurrent of education!</Text>
  <Text ID="15674">People of the New World worship me. Hmmn...</Text>
  <Text ID="15786">Everywhere I go, people seem to look through me. Hmmn...</Text>
  <Text ID="16113">An imperfect sphere, white with light, I grow in darkness, the lady's delight. Hmmn, what is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="16114">Break a piece of me off, and I can provide shade. What am I?</Text>
  <Text ID="16115">When they are green and when they are brown, their bendy mien will cause me to frown. But split in between, for a very short while, they're joyfully yellow and cause me to smile!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What am I?</Text>
  <Text ID="16116">I'm fastest on a full belly, and it sounds like I'm going cheap. What am I? </Text>
  <Text ID="16117">I stop, it keeps running.&lt;br/&gt;What is it? </Text>
  <Text ID="15675">As the holding company, about time you received some additional benefits, eh? Take some surplus product!</Text>
  <Text ID="15676">An associate has bailed on me at the crucial moment. Perhaps you want these gramophones, at a fraction of the usual price?</Text>
  <Text ID="15677">I brought this back from the last trip, but it really does not befit our mantelshelf as I thought it would. Please, you keep it!</Text>
  <Text ID="15678">Productivity— keyword of our time! Use this machine! It will never ask a wage, be indolent, or show up late!</Text>
  <Text ID="15679">The exhibition opening has been a ripping success! Cause for celebration— one I should be honoured to sponsor!</Text>
  <Text ID="15683">I'm always looking to gain an advantage over the competition! Convince them to back-off, and I predict the markets will pick-up.</Text>
  <Text ID="16166">Wood flammable? Hmmn, yes I suppose that is a safety risk, maybe I will invest elsewhere...</Text>
  <Text ID="16167">You're right, I am stressed. And a holiday might keep the whole family quiet for a while...</Text>
  <Text ID="16168">Involved in shady dealings you say? Then I owe you my thanks, and shall withdraw from the deal immediately!</Text>
  <Text ID="15684">I wish to form an investment consortium— and what with so many affluent visitors in the city...any chance you might 'hook us up'?</Text>
  <Text ID="16169">Oh no, I'm terribly sorry, we blew all of our family fortune on this holiday...</Text>
  <Text ID="16170">With a fellow notorious for his disreputable business practices? Never! </Text>
  <Text ID="16171">That sounds a lucrative proposition indeed! I shall accept forthwith!</Text>
  <Text ID="15685">Never mind if Christmas is coming, he shall not have a day off! Where is the fool anyway? Made destitute by his thriftless present-giving perhaps?!</Text>
  <Text ID="16172">Mr Scrounge may seem miserly, but I am certain a candle of charity burns yet in his heart. I shall wish him greetings of the season as I would any other!</Text>
  <Text ID="16173">Bah! Humbug! What reason has he for being so merry?! I am by far the richer, and yet I find that season abhorrent! </Text>
  <Text ID="15686">If we are to drag this place out of the mire, we need talent. Talent I say! If only we could prise some quality away from Sir Archibald's offices of state... </Text>
  <Text ID="16174">Dashed sorry old chap, but I'm a royalist through and through! </Text>
  <Text ID="16175">For some upstart business nonsense? Are you mad? I work for the Queen!</Text>
  <Text ID="16176">Yes! I will join you. After all, I have always been royally undervalued here...</Text>
  <Text ID="15680">The dratted news boys are delivering yesterday's paper to our subscribers! Quick! Collar them before the Financial Express becomes a laughing stock!</Text>
  <Text ID="15681">He was cavorting through the streets in his underwear! Goodness knows how he arrived at such a state of undress, but he must be stopped!</Text>
  <Text ID="15682">Poor, gentle Nelson, he can't have gone far! My little kitty loves the member's club, maybe he is there hoping to catch a few morsels of food?</Text>
  <Text ID="15689">Every impecunious old family seems to be courting my riches with offers of marriage. A few snaps will ensure I'll get more than just a title—if you know what I mean...</Text>
  <Text ID="16177">A solid, industrious frame, but too ancient! No, this old family factory is a lost cause!</Text>
  <Text ID="16178">Ugh! What tired and tumbledown features! I see no prospects here. </Text>
  <Text ID="16179">Oh yes, wowzer! I think we've hit the jackpot. That factory looks ideally situated.</Text>
  <Text ID="15687">Mister Jenkins is the one, I'm sure of it! I pursued him by foot as far as the public mooring— what business can he have there but to be trading my secrets to mafiosi!</Text>
  <Text ID="15688">All they do is complain about being poor! What of hard work? If I did it from nothing, so can they, a photograph of me can prove it!</Text>
  <Text ID="15690">I am smiling for the first time in decades! You must take a photograph! The spirits have shown me the way— oh what a fool I was! I shall give my employee and his family a Christmas to remember! </Text>
  <Text ID="15691">A statue of me will galvanize the layabouts of this city into action! Productivity will soar, and so will profits!</Text>

  <Text ID="16123">Eh, you know what this is? I went for a walk in the mountains and found my paca nibbling on it. Go on, take it, it's not like I need it.</Text>

  <Text ID="15533">My grandkids keep pestering me to play with them. And I'm not the only one, kids here seem to be utterly bored. With some alpaca wool I could make plush toys for them.</Text>
  <Text ID="15534">I remember my mamá cooking for the whole neighbourhood, spreading joy with her homemade fried plantains. I would like to honour her memory doing the same, if you can spare some plantains and oil.</Text>
  <Text ID="16075">There are rumours of a child striving to survive in the wilderness! People say a bear and a panther look after him, but those are no conditions to live in! Could you find him for me? I will take good care of the poor thing.</Text>
  <Text ID="16076">A gang of horribly corrupter police officers are extorting the good people of this town and beating people up when they refuse to comply. They have threatened me too, but not speaking up against injustice is against my nature!</Text>

  <Text ID="16080">Gratitude is so often taken for granted... We have decided to give good where good is due. I know it's a small thing, but we wanted to celebrate everything you've done for us with a present.</Text>

  <Text ID="16084">Today marks the first year anniversary of the rise of our revolution. Your editor wants to feature us freedom fighters in a commemorative article, and since you have been such an inspiration for us it would mean a lot if you could take the snapshot.</Text>
  <Text ID="16085">We are all so proud of all the exemplary improvements you have done here, as should you! Wouldn't it be perfect to celebrate this town with a feature article in your newspaper? It may encourage more people to emigrate to join us!</Text>
  <Text ID="16086">Our society has come such a long way in the past few years! Now a woman can pursue a career in medicine and have her own income and independence without it being frowned upon. My colleagues and I want to set an example for generations to come, could you showcase a picture of us in your newspaper?</Text>
  <Text ID="16088">We are lucky enough to be living times of peace, but many of my comrades are still fighting against the grip of La Corona. They require weapons, but it would be too risky for you to smuggle them yourself. If you entrust me with the supplies, I could sent them to my comrades through our underground network!</Text>
  <Text ID="16089">Many of our comrades are still fighting against La Corona, but their supplies are running low and hunger is starting to wear them down... If you can spare some food, I can make sure it makes their way to them.</Text>
  <Text ID="16090">Most can't imagine how cold nights can get in the open, even if it's warm in daylight. I will never forget the freezing nights when we were running from La Corona. If you can spare some alpaca wool, I can make blankets to send the refugees.</Text>
  <Text ID="16091">It is a real shame that children here have to be home schooled. The experience of sharing knowledge is lost on us. If only we had a museum, we could turn it into a shrine of culture.</Text>
  <Text ID="16092">We have fought long and hard to be rid of tyranny, now is the time for democracy! We need to elect our own representatives, and they can only work from a town hall.</Text>

  <Text ID="16094">Ah, the classics of literature! I abhor the thought of people going about their whole lives without ever reading a page. We need to spark the love for the written word! How about a book exhibition?</Text>
  <Text ID="16095">There are still so many war refugees knocking at our doors, Gobernor. If you were to house them, I am sure they would be more than happy to join our flourishing community!</Text>
  <Text ID="17210">All this running around your city has me starving! It sure is beautiful here, but how can I enjoy anything with a rumbling stomach? Ah, if only I could savour the view with a juicy piece of local meat...!</Text>
  <Text ID="17211">Wonderful, my brains runs a lot better when it's all greased up, if you catch my drift. My name is Dennis Brammen, you could say I'm a content creation specialist. I know exactly what you need to get your city the likes it deserves. I'll write a cool article for your newspaper, just take a picture of your deliciously plump piggies!</Text>
  <Text ID="17212">That's what I call a nice partnership! I like you, buddy, you get my sophisticated palate, and the place's not so bad either! I've invited my whole groups of friends to come over, they'll love it here. Let's join them at the pub!</Text>
  <Text ID="17206">This is the yummiest fish I've ever put in my mouth! But come on, fish is barely an appetiser, right? Keep it coming!</Text>
  <Text ID="17207">Damn that wurst was awesome. What an explosion of flavour! But I think it's time for the main course. I hear your beef is praised far and wide for its high quality!</Text>
  <Text ID="17208">Darn right, that's the stuff!! So oily and tender, it melts in the mouth...! It only needs a nice crispy brown toast on the side.</Text>
  <Text ID="20041">My great passion is fashioning costumes to help bring the past to life! If only I had real images to work from, my designs could be all the more authentic. Perhaps you could photograph museum exhibits from the old northern kingdoms, or even our long-lost ancestors from the Bronze Age for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="20042">Such unbelievable wonders! I'm so inspired now, I need to design new clothes! Still, I feel I'm missing something... A breath of fresh air... Or rather, warm air!</Text>
  <Text ID="20043">It is perfect! After studying this picture and your museum meticulously I have come up with a new design, something I believe has never been done before in the world of fashion. But I need materials from the source, oh, if you could bring some to me...!</Text>
  <Text ID="20044">I am so thrilled to have created a piece that brings together the cultures of both the Old and the New World! You have helped me so much, I would love to repay you by spreading my expertise among your people!</Text>
  <Text ID="21694">Those extinct animals you keep are majestic, magical even. This Giant Deer for instance, is certain to canter across the pages of my new fiction. Still, further research is needed, and I need a place to write the thing. Do you happen to have any suggestions?</Text>
  <Text ID="21695">Astonishing animals you have there! I intend to write a story which depends on real and factual observations of the deep seas, and as such, enjoy any challenge to my misconception of the creatures dwelling therein. Perhaps you have more maritime curiosities to share with me?</Text>
  <Text ID="21696">The other writers believe it is fiction, but I am going insane! Something both terrible and terrific lies beneath our feet, in the abyss, the heavens, trapped in the ice. A cult devoting itself to the same monstrous deity gathers in the New World, I must be present to document our end! Bring me pictures, artifacts, build a hospital to care for those plagued by the coming darkness!</Text>

  <Text ID="17948">Thank you!&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="17949">What you cradle in your hands is the culmination of years of work by our team, delivering an Anno game both we and our fans can be proud of. It is also much more than that! Not only is Anno 1800 the seventh installment in the series, but it also marks the 20th anniversary for the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 years is a significant milestone to reach by any measure, but an especially notable one in an industry as dynamic and fast-paced as digital entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="17950">No-one could have predicted this journey back in March 1998, when an unassuming new challenger entered, named “Anno 1602”, daring to take on the more established strategy competitors of its day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what a journey it has since been!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these 20 years, we have enjoyed our own history together. We have seen the renaissance, and the age of enlightenment. We have even travelled into the future, settled the ocean floor and colonized the moon.&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="17951">None of this would have been possible without you -  the dedicated and passionate Anno fans who have inspired and empowered us every step along the way.&lt;br/&gt;Our community of “Annoholics” has been our driving force, and these 20 years are a testament to their enthusiasm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So no matter if this is your very first Anno (and if so, welcome aboard!), or if you have been with us for two decades - THANK YOU, from the bottom of our hearts!&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="17952">&lt;br/&gt;The Anno 1800 Development Team&lt;br/&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="19828">Thanks for playing ANNO 1800! You are awesome!</Text>

  <Text ID="14364">Bente is the young heir to the Jorgensen Trust, a philanthropic venture of her late father's. She is an alarmingly friendly individual, caring for all around her. &lt;br/&gt;An intrepid traveller, she believes the world exists for all to delight in and explore! Naturally, she is friends with almost everyone...</Text>
  <Text ID="14365">Princess Qing is a young and uncertain envoy of the Imperial East. &lt;br/&gt;Struggling to bring about the very different diplomatic wishes of Emperor and Empress here in a new and unfamiliar place, she takes her consolation in writing wistful poetry on the nature of home.</Text>
  <Text ID="14366">Behind the bold swish of Willie's conjuror's cape lives a fragile mouse, desperate for the affection conferred upon him by his late mother. &lt;br/&gt;Above all, it is fear that grips him— of some unspeakable and ghoulish reprisal— for Willie seems to have acquired his great fortune suspiciously suddenly!</Text>
  <Text ID="14367">George Smith was long ago, a slave. &lt;br/&gt;An explosion at the mine took his father, and deafened him. Finding freedom, George seized the chance to make something of his life, and has now apparently done it all. But don't let that fool you— he's not finished yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="14368">Beryl O'Mara was a goodly soul once— back when she believed her meek shopkeeper husband would escape the debtor's prison. He didn't. &lt;br/&gt;Years later, and it is she running a street game, with the help of her many eyes and ears. She'll invite you in for tea, but don't get too cosy— that's a sawn-off under the floral tablecloth!</Text>
  <Text ID="14369">Artur Gasparov is a self-proclaimed visionary, francophile, and pursuer of architectural perfection. &lt;br/&gt;Breaking from the mirror only to schmooze with the most important critics, Gasparov has little patience for others, or indeed, any empathy at all. As he himself has said, 'every great city is ruined by its people.'</Text>
  <Text ID="14370">Carl, is a repugnant industrialist fat-cat. &lt;br/&gt;Blaming his parents for allowing the once-great name of Von Malching to fade from view, he is ever desperate to rub up with the nobility, and of course, pile up the gold. His philosophy is— money equals reputation, so take, take and take some more!</Text>
  <Text ID="14371">Alonso Graves is a man disturbed. A former soldier of empire, war transformed his soul forever. &lt;br/&gt;The disdain and misanthropy within him can only momentarily be silenced with the blood of his former masters. Believing himself now to be a god, he is intent on 'freeing' all he may from the shackles of human existence.</Text>
  <Text ID="14372">Admiral Vicente Silva is an experienced, calculating and humourless conqueror. His noble upbringing, and education at the finest military academies has primed him for a life in power. &lt;br/&gt;A staunch traditionalist, his conviction is that the crumbling empire of La Corona in whose service he profits, will prevail against a world in rebellion.</Text>
  <Text ID="14373">Lady Margaret Hunt's influence cannot be overestimated. A member of the Royal Council, she is trusted by all, rarely seeking sympathy for what has unquestionably been a difficult life. &lt;br/&gt;After all, she was born a Harlow— a name now synonymous with treason... but then, that was all buried long ago.</Text>
  <Text ID="14374">Anne Harlow is the vengeful leader of a forsaken band— the last hurrah of piracy. She was born into nobility, only to see her father Benjamin hung for speaking against the King. &lt;br/&gt;In exile, Anne's lust to destroy the crown and social order has only grown with the arrival of a new and vulnerable Queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="14375">Jean La Fortune escaped a life of slavery to become the leader of a fledgling nation on the isle his people call High Mountain. &lt;br/&gt;But his people cannot hope to grow while the Empire refuses to recognise their independence. With few allies in society, it seems Jean has little choice left but to fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="18113">Isabel Sarmento is the passionate leader of a rebellion in the New World people call "The Movement", striving for independence from Old World empires. &lt;br/&gt;She lost her brother to the violence, but this only seems to have strengthened her resolve. She knows her people will have to fight clever if they want to build a lasting future together.</Text>
  <Text ID="18114">Eli Bleakworth is a deeply resentful servant of the crown, charged with governing Wormways Prison, a depraved and isolated facility. &lt;br/&gt;Taking great pleasure in carrying out punishments, he is strict and unbending, believing the scum receive only what they deserve. Suspicious to the core, he will no doubt be keeping his beady eyes on you too!</Text>
  <Text ID="18115">Even to browse Kahina's emporium can feel like a privilege, so luxurious are her exotic displays. &lt;br/&gt;But to Kahina, this whole enterprise is rather humdrum. A compromise for her comfort and safety, that seems desperately dull in comparison to the daredevil life of intrigue and prestige that once she led.</Text>
  <Text ID="20097">Sir Archibald Blake is the steadfast counsel of Her Majesty the Queen. Optimistic, tactful and yet frequently awkward, good old Archie just wants everyone to get along. &lt;br/&gt;Years of diplomatic dinners have cultivated in him a great predilection for small talk, which can lead the unwary into believing he is not as wise as in fact, he truly is.</Text>
  <Text ID="20098">Old Nate is a drifter, opportunist and inventor. His life's work is his airship and the island at which it is moored, each a hodgepodge of parts he has obtained over the years, by means unknown. &lt;br/&gt;Occasionally he tolerates crossing paths with others, as long as they are ready to do their bit, and split the spoils down the middle.</Text>

  <Text ID="18884">Worth every penny spent!</Text>
  <Text ID="17926">Very impressive!</Text>
  <Text ID="18885">The best event I ever visited!</Text>
  <Text ID="18886">Everyone praised it on the return trip!</Text>
  <Text ID="18887">Now, the state of the art is established!</Text>
  <Text ID="18888">A sublime, outstanding experience!</Text>
  <Text ID="18889">I desperately want to come back!</Text>
  <Text ID="18890">This will go down in history, for sure!</Text>
  <Text ID="18891">The best trip of my life, certainly.</Text>
  <Text ID="18893">A really awe-inspiring exhibition!</Text>
  <Text ID="18894">I never saw so many happy faces!</Text>
  <Text ID="18895">Wandering through the exhibits was like a waking dream!</Text>
  <Text ID="17919">My water closet has better design than that!</Text>
  <Text ID="18896">Even the exhibition map wasn't drawn correctly!</Text>
  <Text ID="18898">There were gross underestimations of quantity in the organisation!</Text>
  <Text ID="18993">The very foundation of our civilisation is affronted here!</Text>
  <Text ID="18899">You don't build an event like you build a house of cards.</Text>
  <Text ID="18900">An architectural event that can't stand firm, that is the height of hypocrisy!</Text>
  <Text ID="18901">Architecture has nothing to do with magic, neither does this exhibition!</Text>
  <Text ID="17923">I could gather some ideas for refurbishing the drawing room at least.</Text>
  <Text ID="18902">The gardens were somehow... the best designs.</Text>
  <Text ID="18903">Some exposed mosaic in my bathroom might work. I enjoyed that aesthetic.</Text>
  <Text ID="17927">Intricate designs becoming pieces of art!</Text>
  <Text ID="18904">An exhibition matching the quality of its exhibition space.</Text>
  <Text ID="18905">I hope the city council will take some inspiration from this fine exhibition!</Text>
  <Text ID="18906">A modern great wonder of the world this event!</Text>
  <Text ID="18907">The first stone that paves the way to an extraordinary new era in architecture!</Text>
  <Text ID="18910">Monumental! </Text>
  <Text ID="18912">According to my calculations, the verdict is precisely... one out of ten.</Text>
  <Text ID="18913">This exhibition is enough to convert a scientist into a creationist.</Text>
  <Text ID="18914">A complete insult to the scientific progress of our contemporaries.</Text>
  <Text ID="17920">I learned more at school than I did here, and my school was dreadful.</Text>
  <Text ID="18915">Organisation similar to bacterial growth; completely out of control!</Text>
  <Text ID="18916">Perhaps they could invent replacement brains for the organisers.</Text>
  <Text ID="17924">The door opens to truth!</Text>
  <Text ID="18994">Our inventors deserve a bigger stage.</Text>
  <Text ID="18995">A stable element, not great, not bad.</Text>
  <Text ID="17928">This exhibit with a refrigeration machine was my favourite!</Text>
  <Text ID="18996">The daguerreotype was the best way to immortalise this fabulous moment!</Text>
  <Text ID="19018">Incredible machines in an incredible place!</Text>
  <Text ID="19027">This could bring an end to illogical belief systems!</Text>
  <Text ID="19010">Eureka!</Text>
  <Text ID="19016">This will show the world who leads the industrial revolution!</Text>
  <Text ID="19008">This exhibition is pushing the boundaries of what we presume to know!</Text>
  <Text ID="19020">Ancient peoples might be rather embarassd to see what we have become...</Text>
  <Text ID="19021">I felt like a skeleton by the end of it...</Text>
  <Text ID="19022">The exhibition space on its own would probably have been more interesting.</Text>
  <Text ID="17921">The organisation is as outdated as everything on display there...</Text>
  <Text ID="19019">Maybe they found these objects in a children's sandpit.</Text>
  <Text ID="19023">There are more antiquities in my mother's bathroom than there!</Text>
  <Text ID="17925">The same stuff as you might find anywhere: pebbles, broken crokery!</Text>
  <Text ID="19024">Something like those ancient mosaic tiles might look nice in our bathroom.</Text>
  <Text ID="19026">Those mosaics might have looked quite pleasant out on our veranda.</Text>
  <Text ID="19032">Quite a cabinet of curiosities!</Text>
  <Text ID="19028">A true homage to our ancestors.</Text>
  <Text ID="19031">I'm pretty sure those mummies were delighted to meet us!</Text>
  <Text ID="19030">It's far more interactive than the museum!</Text>
  <Text ID="17929">I want to become an archaeologist now! One with a whip!</Text>
  <Text ID="19029">The excellent organisation really allowed the exhibits to sing!</Text>
  <Text ID="19033">Perhaps the remains of this exhibition will be held up one day as those belonging to a great civilisation!</Text>
  <Text ID="19034">The event lacks a bit of ambition.</Text>
  <Text ID="19037">It was rather a modest event...</Text>
  <Text ID="19038">Even for a small event, security should be better!</Text>
  <Text ID="19039">Rather a pifflingly small event, don't you think?</Text>
  <Text ID="19036">I was disappointed there were no delicate fruits and sweetmeats to eat.</Text>
  <Text ID="19035">Not even a single caviar canapé!</Text>
  <Text ID="19040">I think it's just about the right size event, but nothing more.</Text>
  <Text ID="19041">The event seemed no more than ordinary in its organisation. </Text>
  <Text ID="19042">There aren't quite enough nibbles to go around.</Text>
  <Text ID="19043">Even a modest drink selection can make for a successful, albeit modest, event!</Text>
  <Text ID="19044">You might think of organising bigger scale exhibitions!</Text>
  <Text ID="19045">The display of fruits! It was glorious!</Text>
  <Text ID="19046">Bigger events have a lot to learn from this well-organised affair.</Text>
  <Text ID="19047">I would back them to organise something bigger, for sure!</Text>
  <Text ID="19048">A very safe bet: a modest event, but optimal organisation!</Text>
  <Text ID="19049">They should not organise a large event when they can't ensure any security!</Text>
  <Text ID="19050">Where was the banquet? There was barely any food for such a large event!</Text>
  <Text ID="19051">A large venue, without scarcely a decoration! What a pity!</Text>
  <Text ID="19052">I have a sweet tooth and missed some dessert there! Something exotic!</Text>
  <Text ID="19053">Maybe they should scale down to a smaller event...</Text>
  <Text ID="19054">I really missed some kind of banquet.</Text>
  <Text ID="19055">I missed something, but I don't know what... Some booze? Some decoration?</Text>
  <Text ID="19057">Large events require much more organisation!</Text>
  <Text ID="19058">If only this large event were less boring, I would have stayed longer.</Text>
  <Text ID="19059">The little decorations did make the place more welcoming!</Text>
  <Text ID="19060">The exotic desserts were astonishing!</Text>
  <Text ID="19062">The generous drink selection contributed to general feelings of mirth!</Text>
  <Text ID="19061">A very sizeable banquet! I saw many jolly faces around!</Text>
  <Text ID="19063">Everyone agreed that the organiser should make it even bigger next time!</Text>
  <Text ID="19064">You rarely visit large events of such quality!</Text>
  <Text ID="19056">Investing so much money in such a grand event and failing like this, what a waste!</Text>
  <Text ID="19065">The organisers should be investigated for wasting all this money.</Text>
  <Text ID="19066">Nothing to eat and drink at an event that was supposed to be "sumptuous"! A farce!</Text>
  <Text ID="19067">If only there had been games and amusement for the visitors!</Text>
  <Text ID="19068">I read " banquet of great extravagance" on the invitation, but there was no such thing!</Text>
  <Text ID="19069">The decorations were not up to the mark! </Text>
  <Text ID="19071">Still some work for the next one. We want not only a banquet and booze, but games and pastimes!</Text>
  <Text ID="19070">I can see some potential, despite the long queues for the buffet.</Text>
  <Text ID="19072">The decorations could have been a bit better. It was a bit lacklustre.</Text>
  <Text ID="19073">I enjoyed the luxury alcohol, there just wasn't enough of it.</Text>
  <Text ID="19074">The dignitaries really enjoyed the extravagant banquet and leisure activities!</Text>
  <Text ID="19075">Did you see the desserts? Towering centerpieces of culinary art!</Text>
  <Text ID="19076">The visitors jaws dropped when they saw the selection of drinks!</Text>
  <Text ID="19077">A masterpiece of organisation. The grandest and most beautiful event I ever visited!</Text>
  <Text ID="19078">We had only the best in this monumental place. The success of the century!</Text>
  <Text ID="19079">The quality, the refinement, the abundance! This event will go down in history!</Text>

  <Text ID="3040">A young washerwoman rests under a vast vast tree. She secretly is in love but she only dares to carve her beloved's face within the wood. For the boy is very busy person and must not be disturbed.</Text>
  <Text ID="3042">A young painter sits alone in his vast vast workshop. He wishes he could trade the painted flowers for their actual fragrance but he cannot. For his every waking moment must be spent in service of his art.</Text>
  <Text ID="3046">The painter was devoted to his art but his strokes failed to invoke the real world. So one day the painter chose to abandon the brush and engaged in a walk in the shade of the orchard.</Text>
  <Text ID="3047">The washerwoman quivered at the glimpse of her beloved above the hedge. "This will be my only chance" she told herself. "As he may notice me today or never".</Text>
  <Text ID="3044">Quite faithful to the famous royal garden.</Text>
  <Text ID="3045">A haven of peace for ducks and dragonflies.</Text>

  <Text ID="800157">Calico's Rogues Snare a Merchant Ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800158">&lt;b&gt;A helpless merchant brig is being pillaged by despicable pirates.&lt;/b&gt; Its captain is a friend to many of your crew, who are ready to die in order to save him. The pirates answer to Calico Roberts - the last terrible pirate - but the light is dim, and they have not noticed your ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="800159">Ask the advice of your former pirate</Text>
  <Text ID="800163">&lt;b&gt;"I knew this would come in handy someday,"&lt;/b&gt; the old cove mutters, as he unravels the flag of Calico Roberts. "They wouldn't dare tear their master's cloth!" As your ship steers into view with the new flag, the pirates do nothing. They fully believe you serve the same master! Your guns fire and surrender is quick. The merchants are grateful and offer considerable compensation!</Text>
  <Text ID="800160">Fire cannons at the pirates' ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800164">&lt;b&gt;Success comes quickly.&lt;/b&gt; Volley after volley of ordnance so cleanly perforates the pirate hull, it is turned into alpine cheese. The surprised pirates are suddenly waving the white flag, and the skirmish is won. The merchants are thankful to see their goods returned and offer a fitting reward.</Text>
  <Text ID="800166">&lt;b&gt;The attack is an abysmal failure.&lt;/b&gt; Almost every cannon shoots wayward, giving the pirates ample time to prepare their own onslaught. They laugh and cheer, and shout awful things as your tattered ship is forced to flee in shame.</Text>
  <Text ID="800161">Try to board the pirates' ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800165">&lt;b&gt;It's a good fight in which the crew hold their nerve.&lt;/b&gt; At first range-finding proves difficult, alerting the pirates to ready their own guns. But after a few exchanges it is clear who is better-equipped, and the pirates raise the white flag. Although some of the men sustain injuries, the merchants are able to offer financial recompense.</Text>
  <Text ID="800167">&lt;b&gt;The courageous crew triumph,&lt;/b&gt; rushing aboard quickly enough for it to be a surprise, before blowing half the pirates to dust with their blunderbuses. The remaining pirates drop their weapons, and the merchants are able to come out of hiding. 'A great reward is in order', they say, giving you a generous portion of the recovered loot.</Text>
  <Text ID="800168">&lt;b&gt;Victory comes at a cost.&lt;/b&gt; Luck often plays a part in deck skirmishes, and your crew, unable to surprise the wary pirates, must take many casualties before asserting dominance. The merchants are indebted, and reward your rash heroism appropriately.</Text>
  <Text ID="800169">&lt;b&gt;Boarding the ship is a grave mistake.&lt;/b&gt; The pirates are too quick and already have the initiative. The men are forced to retreat, kicking the boarding plank away. [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] and the others are condemened to a no-doubt gruesome fate.</Text>
  <Text ID="800162">Avoid the trouble spot entirely</Text>
  <Text ID="800170">&lt;b&gt;'We're bloomin' cowards!' cries a  furious sailor,&lt;/b&gt; as your ship whisks about, and sails briskly from danger. With the merchant ship left to the dogs, the crew fume at such a display of weakness at their friend's time of need.</Text>
  <Text ID="801025">Dockyard Dupe</Text>
  <Text ID="801026">&lt;b&gt;Robbed!&lt;/b&gt; Having thanked the generous innkeeper, your ship departed what seemed a most hospitable port. Even at the time your crew were surprised to see so many smiling faces gather at the dock to wave you off. A mere hour into the onward journey, it is discovered that a great deal of valuable property is missing from the hold. You must decide now if it's worth going back for.</Text>
  <Text ID="801027">Have your detective investigate</Text>
  <Text ID="801032">&lt;b&gt;The detective already knows the culprit.&lt;/b&gt; "I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but am satisfied they are not." Your ship returns and lays a watertight case before the local authorities against the local innkeeper. He is arrested, your equipment is returned and your ship receives a resupply. It seems that hospitality was genuine!</Text>
  <Text ID="801028">Return and plunder the Harbour</Text>
  <Text ID="801033">&lt;b&gt;Swift justice.&lt;/b&gt; The petty harbour defences crumble in the morning light. Your ship streaks unopposed into what remains of the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. "Please, take anything!" he yelps, "you will find all your things in the warehouse, and more besides." You profit from a scheme that has been running for years.</Text>
  <Text ID="801034">&lt;b&gt;Your assault is too slow.&lt;/b&gt; Just as you begin to gain the upper hand over the defenders, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; a slew of artillery reinforcements. </Text>
  <Text ID="801035">&lt;b&gt;An absolute shambles.&lt;/b&gt; Your men couldn't even best a few locals with a primitive demi-cannon. "Who shall have our guts for garters next?" yelp those who survive the barrage, "A small gang of angry turtles?" Your ship sails hurriedly away.</Text>
  <Text ID="801036">Fight them all</Text>
  <Text ID="801037">&lt;b&gt;You put an end to corruption!&lt;/b&gt; Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all were complicit. "It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob innocent travellers again!" Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.</Text>
  <Text ID="801038">&lt;b&gt;The enemy force is vast.&lt;/b&gt; "How many are there, captain!? We must turn back." But it is too late. Soon it is not just the western cliff lit up with cannonfire, but your ship. Many lives will be lost before you finally crawl out of range.   </Text>
  <Text ID="801039">Make peace, and reason with the officials</Text>
  <Text ID="801040">&lt;b&gt;Despite your earlier aggression, they are wiling to listen.&lt;/b&gt; After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in any dockers who are found to be guilty, and most, if not all of your possessions are returned.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801041">&lt;b&gt;The authorities stand with their own.&lt;/b&gt; Following a ceasefire, you put your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this will mean leaving some of your best sailors behind to help with repairs. </Text>
  <Text ID="801029">Return to the inn in disguise to bait the robbers</Text>
  <Text ID="801042">&lt;b&gt;You rumble the schemers!&lt;/b&gt; The crew set aside superstition, and paint your ship with a different name. The most cut-throat of your sailors pose as wealthy officers, cabin curtains for sashes, so as to appear perfect victims. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.</Text>
  <Text ID="801043">&lt;b&gt;The disguises are unconvincing.&lt;/b&gt; A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port, but moustaches and a change of clothes aren't enough for the sly innkeeper. "Thought you could fool us?" he scoffs.</Text>
  <Text ID="801044">&lt;b&gt;Your disguises are so comically poor&lt;/b&gt;, and yet the innkeeper is the picture of cordiality as he ushers your men to retake their seats. Your men exchange hopeful looks, but the other patrons start laughing. Almost in unison, they have drawn their pistols. "What were we thinking?" mutter your men. "I wonder where you'll end up!" the innkeeper cackles, as he has your crew stripped, bound, and pushed off to sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="801045">Take back what is yours by force</Text>
  <Text ID="801047">&lt;b&gt;Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.&lt;/b&gt; The inn is a hurricane of chairs and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life now security against whatever plunder you please. </Text>
  <Text ID="801048">&lt;b&gt;The locals are brutal.&lt;/b&gt; Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, the bloody remainder, to be packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace. Eventually they will be released, lighter on both goods and personnel. </Text>
  <Text ID="801046">Threaten to expose their scheme</Text>
  <Text ID="801049">&lt;b&gt;The innkeeper agrees to negotiate.&lt;/b&gt; "We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it," he sniffs, "take what's yours and leave." Glad to avoid further trouble, your crew recover their possessions and leave. One can but feel sorry for the next poor victims of this villanous scheme.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801050">&lt;b&gt;"Get out, before we scratch you out!"&lt;/b&gt; growls the innkeeper, his true colours plain. It seems every surly thug in the port is on his side. The expedition must take this loss of time and equipment on the chin. </Text>
  <Text ID="801030">Appeal to the local authorities</Text>
  <Text ID="801051">&lt;b&gt;You make the case well.&lt;/b&gt; "You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!" says the governor, "and of course, you shall have back what was taken." His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but you don't have time to go digging any deeper.</Text>
  <Text ID="801052">&lt;b&gt;They are completely corrupt.&lt;/b&gt; "What an extraordinary tale! I am so glad our little country has fired your imagination!" smiles the governor.</Text>
  <Text ID="801053">Risk implicating the governor</Text>
  <Text ID="801055">&lt;b&gt;"Clever. Very clever,"&lt;/b&gt; admits the medal-draped governor, as he puffs solemnly on his cigar. "How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?" Your emissary doesn't let slip it was pure guesswork. "Go ahead, take whatever you want," he gestures to a warehouse bursting with confiscated goods, "so long as you keep quiet about all this— can't have my superiors finding out." </Text>
  <Text ID="801056">&lt;b&gt;"A grave last mistake,"&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as the poplar-lined grounds of his palace swarm with militia, "arrest these fops!" Your delegation try to resist, but are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must now manage without them.</Text>
  <Text ID="801054">Resort to violence</Text>
  <Text ID="801057">&lt;b&gt;"Alright, alright!"&lt;/b&gt; says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, "take back what you lost. But then you leave." Since the harbour is now so well-guarded, it feels rather an achievement to have forced any sort of compromise. </Text>
  <Text ID="801058">&lt;b&gt;"That was a mistake,"&lt;/b&gt; chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, "arrest them!" Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do. </Text>
  <Text ID="801059">Give up and leave</Text>
  <Text ID="801060">&lt;b&gt;There's widespread frustration among the crew.&lt;/b&gt; "Those instruments were vital for my research!", "You let the beggars off scot free?!", "This expedition is an embarrassment!" Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.</Text>
  <Text ID="801031">Take the loss on the chin</Text>
  <Text ID="801061">&lt;b&gt;There's widespread frustration among the crew.&lt;/b&gt; "Those instruments were vital for my research!", "You let the beggars off scot free?!", "This expedition is an embarrassment!" Hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.</Text>
  <Text ID="801620">Iceberg</Text>
  <Text ID="801621">&lt;b&gt;Your ship is stranded on an iceberg!&lt;/b&gt; It is night. The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship runs the risk in these waters, for slumbering ice giants leer from the darkness in all directions. "Dead ahead!" comes the cry, too late! A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop a berg— in the shape of an upturned molar— beaching it there. The ship is undamaged, if only it could be returned to the water...</Text>
  <Text ID="801622">Break free with dynamite</Text>
  <Text ID="801626">&lt;b&gt;Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,&lt;/b&gt; it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations rings across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the hilarity of all aboard, for they are free once more!</Text>
  <Text ID="801623">Bombard the icy prison</Text>
  <Text ID="801627">&lt;b&gt;Ice crumbles all around such firepower.&lt;/b&gt; Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away the ice dungeon into which the ship has become wedged until the way is clear. Then like a cheerful sea lion the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer and continue on their way.</Text>
  <Text ID="801628">&lt;b&gt;The iceberg fights back.&lt;/b&gt; Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannonfire seems to have woken the ogre below, and to the horror of the crew the vast berg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. Quick action is needed.</Text>
  <Text ID="801629">Get out and push the ship free</Text>
  <Text ID="801631">&lt;b&gt;Your men live for such challenges,&lt;/b&gt; and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. All the while the berg rumbles suggestively, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.</Text>
  <Text ID="801632">&lt;b&gt;It's an uphill struggle.&lt;/b&gt; The pitching of the unstable berg does not help a jot, as the men tumble and slide to find grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, no-one notices one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths. </Text>
  <Text ID="801630">Let the rolling berg toss you into the sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="801633">&lt;b&gt;Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.&lt;/b&gt; After that intial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position. But then everything happens all at once. The berg spins violently, and the ship with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that very serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately the crew come out unharmed.</Text>
  <Text ID="801624">Build something to help you escape</Text>
  <Text ID="801634">&lt;b&gt;The crew assembles a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.&lt;/b&gt;  Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into a wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift, and to their surprise so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it; and it clatters through all icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace, they have been very resourceful.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801635">&lt;b&gt;The wrong wood is selected for the task.&lt;/b&gt; It is a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the captain's cabin. "Whatever it takes," the captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move since the levers lack the requisite spring. They'll need to find another way off this berg. </Text>
  <Text ID="801625">Pray for divine intervention</Text>
  <Text ID="801636">&lt;b&gt;The crew realise they are blessed!&lt;/b&gt; "If God has seen fit to place us here, we should trust in him," says the ship's holy man thoughtfully, "I would not discount that this very berg has sentience! I know of at least one explorer whose expeditions ride their backs by design!" Indeed, the navigators observe that the iceberg is itself moving, and at fair speed, in a desirable direction. This shall make a fine home for a time.</Text>
  <Text ID="801637">&lt;b&gt;The days melt into weeks that melt into months.&lt;/b&gt; Even the probable agnostics among the crew take to prayer, for there is each passing day some fresh cause for optimism, some sign that someone is listening. Spring approaches, and some of the berg has thawed. One of the days a migratory bird is spotted. At long, long last, a vast chunk of the berg separates, leaving the ship mere metres from open water. A day of heaving has it afloat again, though your men have lost all notion of time.</Text>
  <Text ID="801638">&lt;b&gt;There is no-one out there.&lt;/b&gt; After a week perched atop the pink-white berg, supplies diminishing, the gnawing cold, the crew cannot bear to wait any longer. Any help will have to come from within.</Text>
  <Text ID="802094">Sea of Sargassum</Text>
  <Text ID="802095">&lt;b&gt;A ship in need of rescue!&lt;/b&gt; The vast floating tapestries of algae in these windless waters have long been thought impassable. Just when you thought your own vessel had managed to avoid the yellow-orange plants, you see another ship stuck fast! They must also have seen you, because their alarm begins to sound. Having no proper rescue equipment your own ship risks becoming entangled. Should you try to help?</Text>
  <Text ID="802096">A steamship should have nothing to fear here</Text>
  <Text ID="802099">&lt;b&gt;Your steamer glides effortlessly through.&lt;/b&gt; The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife such as crab and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat; and indeed the crew of the ship in distress explain as you tug them into open water, it was not the algae but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="802097">Harpoon them and tug them away</Text>
  <Text ID="802100">&lt;b&gt;A good shot, but there is too little wind to tug them clear.&lt;/b&gt; Having signalled your intention, the gunner sends the harpoon crunching into the other ship's hull. A fine shot considering it was at the limit of the harpoon's range. The calm prohibits pulling them out of the brown mass of algae, so the crew consider their next steps. </Text>
  <Text ID="802102">Throw them a 'life-line'</Text>
  <Text ID="802104">&lt;b&gt;The breeches buoy guarantees a safe rescue.&lt;/b&gt; The crew transform a lifebuoy into a harness, attached to runners which allow it to zip between the two ships once the harpoon rope is drawn taut. The stranded sailors take turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="802105">&lt;b&gt;The breeches buoy shears off into the water&lt;/b&gt; as soon as the first sailor climbs onto the contraption which dangles perilously from the rope between the two ships. Desperate for rescue, the crew of the stranded boat swim for it. After thrashing the distance, the mariners eventually slop aboard, their bodies jaundiced with algae. "Five years we've been stuck here," one stammers angrily. They are going to be quite a burden on your expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="802103">Inspire them to traverse the rope</Text>
  <Text ID="802106"> &lt;b&gt;A surge of belief animates the stranded sailors.&lt;/b&gt; "You are saved!" cries your lookout, "your penance is over!" Under the encouragement of your lieutenants the other crew grab the rope, and with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Your crew's good will has shone through, the grateful survivors join your expedition without a second thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="802107">&lt;b&gt;They take no strength from your crew's silent prayer.&lt;/b&gt; If only someone had offered a few more words of encouragement— anything positive at all. First to cross is an old man so thin, you could fold him up and tuck him in a drawer. Clutching the fibrous rope is challenge enough for his frail wrists, and after a brief struggle with it, he droops off. His crewmates jump in with him, and commence a desperate thrash through the brown sargassum. The few that make it to your ship will only be a burden on your expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="802101">&lt;b&gt;Panicked sailors toss themselves into the algae,&lt;/b&gt; as your stray harpoon crashes wildly through the lower deck, and seawater rushes in through the breach. She is going down! "We brought them to this, we have a responsibility to do something!" yells one of your officers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802108">Send your best swimmers to the rescue</Text>
  <Text ID="802110">&lt;b&gt;Your swimmers are strong and fit enough,&lt;/b&gt; but the malnourished crew of the sinking ship need all the help they can. The algae weighs like a lion's mane on your heroes, as they relay the castaways on-by-one. Once all are accounted for they lie on the burning deck, panting. This whole episode has been exhausting.</Text>
  <Text ID="802111">&lt;b&gt;The rescue is a tragedy.&lt;/b&gt; Your men paddle like puppies in the densely-packed sargassum— it's hard to understand quite how sailors could be so lacking in practice. Gasping, they reach desperately towards the castaways they should be rescuing, as if for support. The undertow of the sinking ship pulls them under. This was all your fault.</Text>
  <Text ID="802109">Leave them to their fate</Text>
  <Text ID="802112">&lt;b&gt;"We did what we could..."&lt;/b&gt; the lieutenant trails off, "...and we can't do much!" answers your steersman darkly. There is so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the sinking boat by. Hands reaching desperately towards you, but the pull of their sinking ship soon has them. It will take an awful lot to lift your crew out of the doldrums.</Text>
  <Text ID="802098">Do not risk it</Text>
  <Text ID="802113">&lt;b&gt;"Don't leave! We've been here for ten years!"&lt;/b&gt; Reads the message in semaphore. There is so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the stranded boat by. A drift of shame. Your crew, yellow-bellied as this sea of sargassum, will need a lot to lift them out of the doldrums.</Text>
  <Text ID="802745">Jolly Roger</Text>
  <Text ID="802746">&lt;b&gt;Pirates!&lt;/b&gt; The torn black flag bearing skull and bones is a shock to those on your expedition who thought they were a dying breed. The weather-worn ship emerges from the mist with every confidence of plundering you to pieces. Astride her bow stands her colourful captain, axe raised, and along her rails, the spectral silhouette of her starving crew, hungry to feed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802747">Manoeuvre into attack position</Text>
  <Text ID="802749">&lt;b&gt;You swivel on a sixpence, ready to blow them away!&lt;/b&gt; Quickly setting sails to curb momentum your ship turns in the shallowest possible arc for a vessel this size, a manoeuvre only a tactician well-accustomed to risk would attempt. Meanwhile, some of the crew have improvised grenades should you want to use them...</Text>
  <Text ID="802751">Fire the cannons!</Text>
  <Text ID="802753">&lt;b&gt;The pirates are sunk&lt;/b&gt; before they have a chance to do any damage at all! Your ship's guns target the most mould-ridden flank of the corsair ship, smashing it through. The antique vessel collapses on itself and your sailors enjoy the resulting plunder almost as if they themselves had been the pesky picaroons.</Text>
  <Text ID="802754">&lt;b&gt;It's a disappointing salvo.&lt;/b&gt; Despite being in a strong position, your cannons are miscalibrated, and end up firing short. The pirates know they cannot win this with their outmoded gunnery, and between shots they draw close and latch onto your ship with their boarding hooks. </Text>
  <Text ID="802755">Defend against the boarding pirates</Text>
  <Text ID="802757">&lt;b&gt;Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.&lt;/b&gt; The rowdy band charge aboard only to find your resolute crew arranged in a classical shield wall, from which poke percussion cap pistols. Although your crew sustain fairly gruesome injuries from pirate axes, all but one survive. That young lad is given a funeral, unlike the poor dead pirates.</Text>
  <Text ID="802758">&lt;b&gt;You're lucky they don't leave with your ship!&lt;/b&gt; Some of your sailors are equipped with old flintlocks, whose inaccuracy permit the enemy to appear at close quarters. The swordplay proceeds so terribly on your side, that a section of the pirates are able to reach the lower deck and pilfer all they find. Thus satisfied, their captain bays "fall back!" and the scourge are gone, leaving your crew to count the dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="802756">Surrender to them</Text>
  <Text ID="802759">&lt;b&gt;"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us,"&lt;/b&gt; your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, and proceeds to strip the chap of his ear. "Sounds fair," he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence, the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="802752">Bombard them with handmade grenades!</Text>
  <Text ID="802760">&lt;b&gt;The pirates don't expect such a crafty attack.&lt;/b&gt; "I was saving these for a special occasion such as this," your weaponsmith burps. The 'special brew' he has concocted consists of a bottle filled with powder, hemp fuse, and a nail surprise. There is a shimmering sound as they explode, and when the smoke clears, your crew frisk the punctured bodies littering the deck, singing "Rollicking band of pirates, we!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802761">&lt;b&gt;Ineffective to say the least.&lt;/b&gt; The improvised grenades are duff fireworks, that when landing on the pirate deck fail to discharge. There is no time to apportion blame, for the tide of battle has swung again in favour of the pirates, who have hooked the two ships together for boarding.</Text>
  <Text ID="802750">&lt;b&gt;The turn is not sharp enough.&lt;/b&gt; There was nothing wrong with the idea, but what tactical advantage your ship may have had is lost with the rather cautious turning circle, out of which the ship emerges a slow-moving target. </Text>
  <Text ID="802762">Position for attack anyway</Text>
  <Text ID="802764">&lt;b&gt;You make the best of a poor position.&lt;/b&gt; At the last moment your maverick navigators cut inside the approaching pirates, who had been hoping to board you. Your crew have the breathing space now to act!</Text>
  <Text ID="802766">Fire all cannons!</Text>
  <Text ID="802768">&lt;b&gt;After a long exchange, the pirates are sunk!&lt;/b&gt; Damage is done to both ships, before finally your men "cross the T" releasing a full broadside at their prow. Immediately the enemy ship is guzzling water. Any plunder floating above their wreck can serve to compensate the small damage you have received.   </Text>
  <Text ID="802769">&lt;b&gt;It is a damaging encounter.&lt;/b&gt; The rotted exterior of the pirate vessel invites cannonfire, but their movements are too clever, never exposing their flanks to a broadside. Keen to corner them, your officers overcommit, and in doing so, leave themselves open to a devastating barrage. The pirates take the chance to flee, which is fortunate, because your ship is almost dead-in-the-water.</Text>
  <Text ID="802767">Board them!</Text>
  <Text ID="802770">&lt;b&gt;Your crew go beserk for the fight.&lt;/b&gt; Most of the ramshackle pirate crew fall in the first bloodthirsty charge, while your raiders suffer only one or two casualties. While the pirates bleed out, your men deprive them of any ill-gotten plunder they have. Then you scupper the barque, and watch as it disappears, black flags and all, to meet Davy Jones.</Text>
  <Text ID="802771">&lt;b&gt;Your crew don't seem too keen.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they know they have no chance hand-to-hand with seasoned pirates. As the two ships adjoin, it is the pirates who make the charge. Almost immediately, a pirate swings an axe an lops off a head. Horrified, your steersman hurriedly spins your ship away, with fighters on both sides falling into the resulting gap. Your depleted crew flees at full speed. </Text>
  <Text ID="802765">&lt;b&gt;The navigators fail to recover&lt;/b&gt; from the initial setback. Your helmsman has no tricks up his sleeves, and cannot pick up speed to outrun the approaching pirates. They intend to board you!</Text>
  <Text ID="802772">Fight them to the death</Text>
  <Text ID="802774">&lt;b&gt;It is a saddening scene.&lt;/b&gt; To see this many brave fighters put to the sword is regrettable. Fortunately the losses are largely on the other side, the pirates' antique weaponry ever more a disadvantage in the modern age. When the last scrawny dog is dead, you set their ship alight like a funeral barque. Your own sailors, still twitching from the skirmish, pour themselves long jars of rum, and remember the fallen. </Text>
  <Text ID="802775">&lt;b&gt;You are no match for the pirates. &lt;/b&gt; Attackers pour in like beetles from all sides, a many-legged brood washing over your forces like some unstoppable plague, crushing all resistance. "I know it's a good'un but we ain't taking the ship..."  the pirate captain is heard to utter by a few survivors cowering behind a locked door, "...just everything on it!" When the sound of looting and cheering has died away, the survivors emerge to find the expedition ship stripped of pretty well everything it has.</Text>
  <Text ID="802773">Listen to reason and surrender</Text>
  <Text ID="802776">&lt;b&gt;Should have waved the white flag sooner.&lt;/b&gt; Your weapons drop and the pirate captain saunters aboard. She is tall and surprisingly aged, dressed in the dashing clothes of a bygone era, "For our trouble, we'll have some of yer crew for slaves," she growls, "all of 'em left of this line." She swishes her cutlass and portions off several of your crew for her playthings. After that she turns more amicable, as her horde loot your ship. As they leave she drops a feathered glove to show her gratitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="802763">Surrender</Text>
  <Text ID="802777">&lt;b&gt;"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us,"&lt;/b&gt; your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, and proceeds to strip the chap of his ear. "Sounds fair," he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence, the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="802748">Have an officer make a rousing speech</Text>
  <Text ID="802778">&lt;b&gt;Your men are resolute following the speech.&lt;/b&gt; Your acting lieutenant points his sabre to the sky, defying the heavens themselves. "If I, born with gas light, heated water, a silver spoon in mouth..." with each fresh admission a cheer goes up, "If I, can enjoy chopping through these mangy pirates, then you lot will bloody well be in heaven!" There is a raucous cheer as the men prepare for orders. </Text>
  <Text ID="802780">Board the pirate ship!</Text>
  <Text ID="802782">&lt;b&gt;It is indeed an heroic charge.&lt;/b&gt; Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a mangled trail in their wake. The black flag is ripped from the mast and the pirate's booty is plundered. Then your lieutenant impishly permits the survivors to go free— "Come now, be humble in thy victory! For how dull the world would be without those old pirate salts!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802783">&lt;b&gt;Pirates are always ready for a skirmish!&lt;/b&gt; Having delayed boarding until they were properly armed and ready, your men fail to make use of their conviction. On seeing the pirate planks fall first, your lieutenant backtracks, urging caution in the face of the oncoming horde!</Text>
  <Text ID="802784">Stay put and pick them off</Text>
  <Text ID="802786">&lt;b&gt;You only take a few losses&lt;/b&gt; between reloads, when wild pirates set upon the soldiery with cutlasses and handaxes. Suddenly there is a cry from the pirate ship. The pirate captain is hit! Clutching her chest she is borne away below deck on the shoulders of her shipmates. The pirates immediately withdraw so they may attend to their queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="802787">&lt;b&gt;The first round of rifle fire misses,&lt;/b&gt; and there is no time for a second before the horde are on top of your crew, binding them and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's done, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before they wish you "fair winds", and depart, cackling with glee.</Text>
  <Text ID="802785">Charge anyway!</Text>
  <Text ID="802788">&lt;b&gt;Your men don't hesitate having come this far.&lt;/b&gt; There is a din as the two packs collide, like rugby footballers, over the divide between the boats. Blood surges over the wooden boards, as men fall on both sides. Finally the pirates are driven back, at which outcome they retract their boarding planks and catching the breeze, spin away to prey on victims less chewy.</Text>
  <Text ID="802789">&lt;b&gt;Your men hesitate a second too long,&lt;/b&gt; and the pirates have made up the distance between the ships. Now they have been allowed aboard they have the upper hand and are soon on top of your crew, binding them and maiming those who resist. When the hurly-burly's done, the pirates prop your bound survivors against each other as they trawl the ship for goodies, before they wish you "fair winds", and depart, cackling with glee.</Text>

  <Text ID="802779">&lt;b&gt;There's neither spirit nor courage to be roused.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew instead seem transfixed by the approaching spectre of doom. Even as the horde board, the defenders minds seem elsewhere, hypnotised perhaps by the tall and angular captain with greying hair and wizened visage, who stalks the deck juicing your sailors. Once the pirates have taken everything they desire, they leave as mysteriously as they appeared. </Text>
  <Text ID="803029">The Breakout</Text>
  <Text ID="803042">&lt;b&gt;Unfair imprisonment!&lt;/b&gt; While enjoying some well-deserved shore leave, a local militia seizes a dozen members of your expedition without explanation. They are taken to a fortress hollowed from the sandstone cliffs that dominate the harbour. The charges against your crew prove spurious to say the least, and when a hefty sum is demanded in exchange for their release, the militia's intentions become all too plain.</Text>
  <Text ID="803031">Pay the outrageous fine</Text>

  <Text ID="803037">&lt;b&gt;The fine is duly paid.&lt;/b&gt; Of course, your crew boil as the militia counts the payment and divides it up between them, all the while flapping without remorse about the noble old art of bribery. Yet your sailors take comfort they have been allowed to leave safe and sound, and mark the harbour on the map with the noble intention of forewarning other seafarers of the ruse.</Text>
  <Text ID="803036">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="803038">&lt;b&gt;No fine, no prisoners.&lt;/b&gt; The militia makes it clear: your crew members will not be freed unless their ludicrous demands are met.</Text>
  <Text ID="803032">Try to break the prisoners out</Text>
  <Text ID="803039">&lt;b&gt;You secure an early release!&lt;/b&gt; Your men return to the ship and wait for night. At the sign of a signal flare, the prisoners anticipate your course of action and answer at each window grille with candles. After careful calibration of the cannons, a second flare goes up signalling the imminent blast. The candles extinguish in aknowledgement before the ship's guns sound. The cliff wall of the fortress crumbles away! Taking their chance the prisoners launch themselves into the water below, just as your ship passes by. Tales of the daring rescue will be going around for years.</Text>
  <Text ID="803040">&lt;b&gt;You make a mess of the fortress and the poor people inside.&lt;/b&gt; The guns are loosed at the cliff, but your artillerymen have not taken enough care in their calculations. The fortress walls burst easily enough, but the occupants of the cells are either killed in the blast or plunge to their deaths on the rocks below. As your expedition makes a hasty exit, the crew try to come to terms with what they have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="803033">Leave without the captive sailors</Text>
  <Text ID="803041">&lt;b&gt;"I believe that is the last we shall see of them,"&lt;/b&gt; lament the sailors that night, as the anchor is raised and the westerly breeze tears them away from that unforgiving fortress. As they depart, candles appear at the grille of each cell, signifying— in the imagination of your crew at least— a unanimous verdict of reproach. </Text>
  <Text ID="800277">The Ghost Ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800254">&lt;b&gt;After weeks of hot weather, supplies of drinking water have become dangerously low.&lt;/b&gt; It therefore seems a minor miracle when a fellow ship appears on the horizon, for surely they have water to share? But as it draws near, the crew is aghast, for there is no sign of life aboard. "It is a ghost ship, we must flee before it is too late!" they cry.</Text>
  <Text ID="800255">Send a diver to check it out</Text>
  <Text ID="800258">&lt;b&gt;The diver does remarkably&lt;/b&gt; to spot the fiends furled in sails, or waiting under barrels to ambush, should your men have boarded. Your ship draws alongside the vessel as if to pass, but then unleashes enough cannon-fire to drown it. The crew are elated, believing they have done the oceans a great service.</Text>
  <Text ID="800256">Heathen superstition! Board the ship!</Text>
  <Text ID="800259">&lt;b&gt;Heavens shine upon you,&lt;/b&gt; for whatever caused the crew to vacate this ship seems no longer a concern. Better yet, the lord has seen fit to provide the water you seek. </Text>
  <Text ID="800260">&lt;b&gt;The ship's hold contains an unholy mound&lt;/b&gt; of corpses. "God hath forsaken these men", says the doctor, "but how?"</Text>
  <Text ID="800262">Have the doctor investigate what happened</Text>
  <Text ID="800264">&lt;b&gt;"We are lucky indeed,&lt;/b&gt; for malaria cannot reach us now." says the doctor confidently. This swift diagnosis confirms the crew are pleased to load up the drinking water they have been gasping for.</Text>
  <Text ID="800265">&lt;b&gt;"Touch nothing! Get off the ship,"&lt;/b&gt; frets the doctor, who believes a dreadful plague has taken the crew of this ill-fated vessel. Perhaps drinking water is itself the cause. The crew are miserable time has been wasted, and that their thirst is still not slaked. </Text>
  <Text ID="800266">&lt;b&gt;The doctor is inconsolable,&lt;/b&gt; "it is plague. I lanced a bubo, and it ruptured suddenly upon my person!" That the water be contaminated is misery enough, but to have to abandon the good doctor is a disaster! Your expedition drifts glumly on. </Text>
  <Text ID="800263">Leave the ship immediately </Text>
  <Text ID="800267">&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the grotesque mound of corpses,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if "gift horses always be looked in the mouth."</Text>
  <Text ID="800261">&lt;b&gt;The crew are so faithless,&lt;/b&gt; that every creaking plank aboard the ghostly ship raises a whimper. So when a banshee howl erupts from below deck, every sailor runs for their life. One poor soul trips in a coil of rigging and cracks their head upon an iron capstan. The death exposes all the more the crew's foolishness.</Text>
  <Text ID="800257">Leave and hope to find an island with drinking water soon</Text>
  <Text ID="800268">&lt;b&gt;No relief at escaping the disturbingly empty ship,&lt;/b&gt; can compensate the terrible thirst of your crew. There are murmurings that no such expedition can succeed if "gift horses always be looked in the mouth."</Text>
  <Text ID="800269">&lt;b&gt;Terrifyingly, the ship takes after yours in pursuit.&lt;/b&gt; Who knows what dread hands operate its multifarious controls!</Text>
  <Text ID="800270">Try to outrun the awful vessel!</Text>
  <Text ID="800272">&lt;b&gt;Your ship manages to escape&lt;/b&gt; the ghoulish clutches of that unwholesome adversary, but have no drinking water, or anything else, to show for the ordeal.</Text>
  <Text ID="800273">&lt;b&gt;Your ship is not agile enough.&lt;/b&gt; Men pour into the waves from where enemy cannons punch holes. Seemingly contented with this sacrifice, the dread sentience commanding the vessel calls off its dreadful pursuit.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800271">Turn and face it, whatever it is!</Text>
  <Text ID="800274">&lt;b&gt;Pirates! But trickery cannot match the power of a modern seaship!&lt;/b&gt; Summarily demolished, a few of them are left clinging to wreckage. They beg to join your cause - unpaid. Such are the dwindling prospects of piracy in this day! The crew will jibe at them, but secretly all must be elated to have acquired such sea-wisdom for free.</Text>
  <Text ID="800275">&lt;b&gt;A pirate nuisance!&lt;/b&gt; Though their scurvy deception gives them advantage, they are like many of their creed, rather jaded. By the time their ship is sunk, it has cost you a few good men. Yet the recovery of precious drinking water in among the flotsam, assuages the grief of your crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="800276">&lt;b&gt;Bloody pirates! A terrible menace even in this day and age!&lt;/b&gt; Your crew are outmanoeuvered, outsmarted, and your ship is reeled-in for boarding. Many are killed in valiant defence of the company, but to no avail. Your vessel is duly ransacked for supplies, before the villains are again on their way.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800537">The Visitation</Text>
  <Text ID="800538">&lt;b&gt;An undesirable visitor haunts the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Fleeting silhouettes, knocking and screeching sounds. Each morning the ship appears in utter disarray. "A night fiend," gulps the hardiest of old crewmen, as he sweeps debris from the deck. As night draws in again, you realise something must be done.</Text>
  <Text ID="800539">Listen to your expert</Text>
  <Text ID="800543">&lt;b&gt;Every right to a little joke.&lt;/b&gt; "These claw marks!" the naturalist feigns horror. "Is it something terrible?!" asks a fearful sailor. But the naturalist can bite tongue no longer, and succumbs to laughter; "No! Good heavens. We have a mother and kittens aboard!" The cat family is found in a barrel, which, it is agreed, shall serve as their home for the duration. The crew dote on the little rascals, their presence a great comfort.</Text>
  <Text ID="800540">Perform an exorcism</Text>
  <Text ID="800544">&lt;b&gt;Each sailor strides with inner conviction,&lt;/b&gt; as they form a procession of candles behind the smug-looking priest, flooding holy light into every heathen crevice. The priest's ritual is unfaltering, and not only are the crew rid of the night-time menace, but now believe it is god's plan the expedition will succeed.</Text>
  <Text ID="800545">&lt;b&gt;The crew has its sceptics,&lt;/b&gt; even though the exorcism seems at first to have worked. Two days later a sailor cries, "It had glowing yellow eyes!" upon having sighted the demon near the hold. The unholy thing must be caught.</Text>
  <Text ID="800546">Bait the thing with food</Text>
  <Text ID="800547">&lt;b&gt;It is nothing so savage.&lt;/b&gt; All are concealed around the strip of meat, expecting the worst. But what descends from the rafters of the hold, silent and gentle winged, is a luminous white owl. It is an ambiguous omen, according to those that know, but the sailors are content to keep it aboard. </Text>
  <Text ID="800548">&lt;b&gt;Whatever it is, it is far too clever.&lt;/b&gt; It avoids the bait, but continues its night raids. Rumour this is an offended Klabautermann are substantiated by several separate accounts. Little voices overheard, brief sightings, even the discovery of a miniature table and chair. Some can live with the impish nuisance, but many will jump ship at the next port..</Text>
  <Text ID="800549">Build a trap to catch the thing</Text>
  <Text ID="800550">&lt;b&gt;The cage-trap is well-made,&lt;/b&gt; and daybreak reveals an unlikely specimen encaged. "A sort of badger?" is the first analysis, which in actuality, is fairly far from the mark. The compendium of animalia in the ship's library reveals it a "northern raccoon", also remarking that is "quite edible." </Text>
  <Text ID="800551">&lt;b&gt;The snapping trap is weak and flimsy.&lt;/b&gt; The crew are excited by a sharp sound, but rush to the scene, only to find the bait gone, and the trap in disrepair. A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. "Klabautermann!" they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="800552">&lt;b&gt;The crew don't have much belief,&lt;/b&gt; and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something "irrefutably demonic."</Text>
  <Text ID="800554">Gather arms and confront it</Text>
  <Text ID="800557">&lt;b&gt;Rather excessive.&lt;/b&gt; The soldiery tense as strange noises draw near. Fingers itch upon triggers. The moment demon wings flap into view, the night is lit up with powder. Finally the smoke subsides, and the mangled thing is revealed to be nothing more than a bat. Troops thunder heavily about the ship, before discovering the rest of the hognosed critters in the hold. Everyone is left feeling utterly stupid.</Text>
  <Text ID="800558">&lt;b&gt;Your lily-livered cowards quiver like jelly!&lt;/b&gt; Fear chokes them as they spin wildly about looking for something to shoot that they can't see. Two are so panicked they bump together, causing the other to suddenly fire. Shot hits an angelic young sailor, killing instantly. The night terror is gone, but has taken for payment the most undeserving of souls.</Text>
  <Text ID="800555">Sate the demon with a sacrificial offering</Text>
  <Text ID="800559">&lt;b&gt;A man's finger for a stowaway weasel!&lt;/b&gt; In good faith, a pious sailor volunteers the pinkie of his right hand as a votive offering. But at the smell of blood, it is a slinky little mustelid that appears. With the weasel caught and caged, the night terror is over, but the sailors will not forgive or forget the loss of a good man's finger. </Text>
  <Text ID="800560">&lt;b&gt;Sacrilege!&lt;/b&gt; A prohibited tome is consulted, the vile solicitations of its pages consuming the crew! Unspeakable acts are performed upon a man, so that the demon can be be assuaged. Yet still the menace remains, and worse, the crew's sacrificial victim bleeds out from his injuries.</Text>
  <Text ID="800556">Don't anger the creature further</Text>
  <Text ID="800561">&lt;b&gt;The practical joke is ruined.&lt;/b&gt; The bored sailors bemoan the pathetic response to their little entertainment. That the senior officers have been duped by an obvious ruse, makes all severely doubt their fitness to lead.</Text>
  <Text ID="800553">&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew never take any part of the exorcism seriously.&lt;/b&gt; "What's the point of hocus-pocus when its but greedy sailors stealing?!" yells one man. Accusations fly between conspiracy theorists, until a violent brawl breaks out. At the next mooring, the injured parties desert your godless expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="800541">Find the culprit</Text>
  <Text ID="800563">&lt;b&gt;Your sharp-nosed hunters pick up a scent.&lt;/b&gt; Pungent droppings demarcate a perimeter, in the centre of which is a crate with a hole. A sailor reaches his arm bravely in. There is a brief struggle, and a whine like the ones at night, before the troublemaker is pulled out. It is a common garden fox. The cunning little creature becomes the crew's talisman for the remainder of the expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="800564">&lt;b&gt;Hunters find tracks, but can't say what made them.&lt;/b&gt; The marks are indeed strange - disturbing almost. Claw marks that go deep in the decking, as if the unspeakable thing that made them was in some frenzy.    </Text>
  <Text ID="800566">Smoke it out of hiding</Text>
  <Text ID="800569">&lt;b&gt;Reassuringly human coughing comes from within.&lt;/b&gt; It turns out you have a stowaway - a young girl wishing to escape a life of hardship. She is spirited., and the crew take to her quickly. She is given work to do, and food to eat. All believe she shall prove their good luck charm.</Text>
  <Text ID="800567">Build a trap to catch whatever it is</Text>
  <Text ID="800570">&lt;b&gt;Knowing its habits helps.&lt;/b&gt; The box is made to measure, and along with its clever latch, is placed where the fiend seems most often to be. The box is found in the morning, with a gigantic rat inside it. The trap appears to have killed it, and that is the end of the matter. </Text>
  <Text ID="800571">&lt;b&gt;The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.&lt;/b&gt; While to some they apear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.</Text>
  <Text ID="800568">Pray together against the spirit</Text>
  <Text ID="800572">&lt;b&gt;A feeling of calm descends upon the crew.&lt;/b&gt; The prayer seems to fill the spiritual void in the sailor's breasts. Approaching the world with a new perspective means even if the unexplained episodes at night persist, they pay it no mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="800573">&lt;b&gt;The communal prayer is broken by more wild shrieking.&lt;/b&gt; It matters not that, apart from vanishing supplies, the mischievous spirit seems fairly harmless. The crew are deeply troubled, and worry their souls are lost.</Text>
  <Text ID="800565">&lt;b&gt;The hunters stumble guilelessly into its trap.&lt;/b&gt; The night is unfeasibly pitch, and the hunters' lamps extinguish. Who knows why, without a breath of wind? A scratching draws near. Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence.  Just like that, the fiend  has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed. </Text>
  <Text ID="800542">Ignore the menace</Text>
  <Text ID="800574">&lt;b&gt;The menace is very persistent.&lt;/b&gt; Restless nights, devoured food, and stolen supplies shall go unexplained and unresolved for the remainder of the expedition. The crew are at their wit's end.</Text>
  <Text ID="800972">Gate of Fire</Text>
  <Text ID="800973">&lt;b&gt;Everything points towards the fiery gate.&lt;/b&gt; It appears like a hallucination, an ancient stone doorway suffused with blue flame set into the rock face. Perhaps a long lost people constructed it, as a shortcut through the high ridge dividing the region. Your men consider it an auspicious sign to enter, but perhaps it would be safer to take the long way through the dense jungle.</Text>
  <Text ID="800974">Have the scientist inspect the gate</Text>
  <Text ID="800975">Have faith and leap through the flames</Text>
  <Text ID="800976">Wrap up in something before leaping through</Text>
  <Text ID="800977">Cut through the jungle instead</Text>
  <Text ID="800978">&lt;b&gt;The scientist banishes all illusions.&lt;/b&gt; "This fire that you perceive around the gate, is simply the agglomeration of azure glow-worms." Laughter becomes delight, as the party take the pulsing creatures in hand. Indeed, they are of great help navigating the dark tunnel to the far side of the ridge, saving you days of trekking.</Text>
  <Text ID="800979">&lt;b&gt;If anything the flames are cool&lt;/b&gt;, as if like bundles of ribbons brushing the skin. This gate is, without question, an earthly manifestation of the divine, for not far along the tunnel, the light breaks in once more, and your party arrive on the far side of the ridge, spiritually tranquil, and having saved days of trekking.</Text>
  <Text ID="800980">&lt;b&gt;Some of the crew remain doubtful.&lt;/b&gt; Drawing a little closer to the gate, they are surprised to feel no heat coming from the fire. One leap of faith and they would be through! Still they hesitate, for a perfect human skeleton lies just the other side of the threshold.</Text>
  <Text ID="800981">&lt;b&gt;Alas! Fire and brimstone!&lt;/b&gt; Some of the crew seem entranced by the glowing entrance. The temperatures are volcanic, but the diabolic procession of fanatics are numb to the pain. The others watch horrified, as fabric, skin and flesh renders before their eyes. It makes the long way round seem a miracle of mercy. </Text>
  <Text ID="800982">Try to determine how the person died</Text>
  <Text ID="800983">Order them to charge through!</Text>
  <Text ID="800984">&lt;b&gt;The doctor forms a decent hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;, and the crew are convinced. "Even from afar, I can see the bones are in poor condition, not burned, but malnourished." Anxious not to end the same way, the crew take a gamble, and are astonished to discover that leaping through the gate does them no harm. They follow the tunnel to the other side of the ridge. "I wonder if it was those frogs we licked..." the doctor mumbles.</Text>
  <Text ID="800985">&lt;b&gt;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor makes several sweeping assumptions, finally concluding, "exhaustion, I'm quite certain. That they died at this particular place is only coincidence." As the first volunteer crosses the threshold, flames grasp his ankles, then shoot rapidly up and over his body. He drops upon the stone floor, taking his place beside the last poor fool. Horrified, your expedition must go the long way round. </Text>
  <Text ID="800986">&lt;b&gt;"Ouch!"&lt;/b&gt; The men yelp, rolling in the stone passageway beyond, until they are sure they are no longer afire. The strange gate behind them, your brave soldiers compare their ugly burns as they march through the tunnel to the far side of the ridge.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800987">&lt;b&gt;"Cowards!"&lt;/b&gt; Your men lack the discipline to follow a simple order! You will have to find another way.</Text>
  <Text ID="800988">&lt;b&gt;They make it.&lt;/b&gt; Rolled-up like carpets they skip over the strange and fiery threshold. As they wend their way through the passage to the other side of the ridge, their worst complaint is the overwhelmingly sweet pong of sweat that is sure to follow them for the rest of the journey. Still, all remain curious as to what that gate really was.</Text>
  <Text ID="800989">&lt;b&gt;"That he died like a sausage?!&lt;/b&gt; Or what shall I tell his family!?" Either way your volunteer leapt through fire and paid with his life. Who knows, perhaps dousing his mantlecoat in a protective layer of paraffin was a mistake! Your expedition will have to trudge the miserable way round.</Text>
  <Text ID="800990">&lt;b&gt;The crew have no regrets&lt;/b&gt; in plotting what they perceive to be a safer, more rational course. Sweaty jungles are the devil they know, snakes and spiders notwithstanding. They make good time and soon find a shallow incline that leads them up and over to the far side of the ridge. Still, many are curious to know the sorcery governing the gate they saw. </Text>
  <Text ID="800991">&lt;b&gt;The jungle thins out to a precipice,&lt;/b&gt; that seems to form part of the ridge you are trying to cross. A long and shoddy-looking bridge stretches to the other side if you want to risk it, or else you could attempt to take an even larger detour. </Text>
  <Text ID="800992">&lt;b&gt;There is no way through,&lt;/b&gt; thanks to your shambolic mapreading, as the jungle grows thicker and danker. The group tire, having many disagreements, and separate into factions. The sensible ones stick together, and decide the only realistic option is to backtrack several weeks. The rest will die among the roots and ferns.</Text>
  <Text ID="800993">Take the bridge</Text>
  <Text ID="800994">Circumnavigate the ridge</Text>
  <Text ID="800995">&lt;b&gt;Inspection shows it to be in passable condition.&lt;/b&gt; There are a few nerve-wracking moments during the crossing, as the wind whips up, and the rickety bridge begins to sway. In any case, all are rather pleased to reach the other side, from where they succeed in reaching the far side of the ridge.</Text>
  <Text ID="800996">&lt;b&gt;Only a fool would ever set foot on it!&lt;/b&gt; Of course it is nothing if not dramatic, when the bridge cables twang, and one after the other your men pile into the gorge. The craftsmen who had been so very confident in the deathtrap structure hang back in shame as the expedition wends sorrowfully the long way round the ridge.</Text>
  <Text ID="800997">&lt;b&gt;It is a long trek&lt;/b&gt;, that could have been much longer but for sound map-reading and compass work. The vegetation is thick and stubborn. Your expedition hack their way through with irritation, marking yet another hiccup for the expedition log book.</Text>
  <Text ID="800998">&lt;b&gt;Imbecile orienteers!&lt;/b&gt; There is no other way across this river valley for a hundred miles! You have covered half that distance before you realise, but having wasted a lot of time and provisions, your men may as well see this major boo-boo through. It is almost three weeks of struggle, before your expedition is back on track. </Text>
  <Text ID="802269">Song Of The Sea</Text>
  <Text ID="802270">&lt;b&gt;The lookout is sure of himself: he has sighted a mermaid.&lt;/b&gt; In the hot noon sun, sailors suspend their duties and rush to inspect the mirror waters for a sign of the creature. Lo! There is something—  a glimmer of silver tail, and a sweet yet melancholy melody that follows behind it. Surely it is mermaid song!</Text>
  <Text ID="802272">Ask for expert opinion</Text>
  <Text ID="802274">&lt;b&gt;"Something just as rare and no less magical!" chuckles your zoologist,&lt;/b&gt; and proceeds to dive after the creature, resurfacing a short while later. "Poor little soul seems to have been separated from its mother," your zoologist splutters, clutching a juvenile specimen of an obscure sea-dweeling species. "Would you chaps kindly running her a bath? I think we better take her with us." From now on, whenever your crew feel sad, they can stop by the creature's tub and enjoy its special warblings.</Text>
  <Text ID="802275">Answer the mermaid's call with a sailor's chant</Text>
  <Text ID="802276">&lt;b&gt;Not one, but a dozen strange sea creatures answer the spirited shanty,&lt;/b&gt; swimming and leaping joyfully alongside your vessel. Since they seem like no creature you have ever seen, it might be an opportunity to catch a specimen for the benefit of natural science...</Text>
  <Text ID="802277">Try to catch one alive</Text>
  <Text ID="802278">&lt;b&gt;A fine catch!&lt;/b&gt; Taking care not to hurt the beautiful creature, your fishermen haul the great net from the water, and let her slop into a tub they have prepared in the hold. The crew take to calling her "Mermaid". Though she has been separated from her pod, she seems to enjoy being doted upon, and will certainly be kept well fed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802279">&lt;b&gt;The men aren't used to catching fish alive.&lt;/b&gt; They trap one of the creatures alright, but hoist the net so roughly it provokes the creature to struggle. It contorts desperately, striping its flippers a glistening red, before finally wrenching itself free. Reunited, the 'mermaids' flee to the depths, and your sailors are left songless but for the howl of the winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="802280">Leave the poor creatures be</Text>
  <Text ID="802281">&lt;b&gt;An otherworldly duet.&lt;/b&gt; The creatures dance over the waves, as your sailors song reprises, "I dreamed a dream the other night/Lowlands, lowlands away, my John/My love she came all dressed in white/My lowlands away". There is no greater source of pride for a sailor, than having made peace with the ocean. </Text>
  <Text ID="802282">&lt;b&gt;The mermaid vanishes.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors drawl a patriotic war ballad they are fond of, but it has a threatening air and she does not deign to answer. Blue in the face from trying, the sailors mourn the ill omen of the mermaid's disappearance, permitting themselves no more thoughts of she and her sisters, or their undersea kingdom.</Text>
  <Text ID="802283">&lt;b&gt;When the mermaid disappears, a sailor dives in after her!&lt;/b&gt; Your irreverent sailors pick a lewd shanty to sing. Angry this moment of innocence is being spoiled, the empassioned young man tosses himself to sea to pursue the fleeting creature. He is not much of a swimmer.</Text>
  <Text ID="802284">Save the poor boy!</Text>
  <Text ID="802285">&lt;b&gt;He has coughed up a lot of water, but he'll live.&lt;/b&gt; The navigators scream for someone to jump in after him, to give them time to bring the ship about. The boy is already sinking by the time his comrade catches up with him, but he is hauled to the surface where the ship is now waiting. When he finally comes to, the boy describes how beautiful the mermaid was, and how invitingly her tail swished. The sailors are so jealous of the boy, they instantly regret having bothered to save him. </Text>
  <Text ID="802286">&lt;b&gt;Pursuing in the ship is a mistake.&lt;/b&gt; You lose sight of the boy, until someone realises he must have slipped underneath the keel. Divers emerge with the pale dead boy in their arms. So the stories of mermaids are true, but that is not the only hard lesson your crew have learned this day.</Text>
  <Text ID="802287">Let the fool go if that's what he wants</Text>
  <Text ID="802288">&lt;b&gt;The smitten boy drowns.&lt;/b&gt; He paddles himself to exhaustion, driven on by the hope of something better. Whatever that noble feeling was, you are fairly certain it won't be the emotion written on his face as he asphyxiates. His letters later show a preexisting disillusionment with life aboard ship, describing a "a culture of bullying most uncivil."   </Text>
  <Text ID="802289">Convince the sailors to ignore the creature</Text>
  <Text ID="802290">&lt;b&gt;Duty trumps distraction.&lt;/b&gt; Awoken by the earnest plea of the presiding officer, the sailors return immediately to their posts. The officer makes the case that it "can be a great source of pride not to have given in to temptation," and that "this is our way of life at sea." Plugging their ears with wax like the heroes of an ancient tale, the men now seem more concentrated than ever on overcoming far greater challenges ahead. </Text>
  <Text ID="802291">&lt;b&gt;Curiosity gets the better of your crew.&lt;/b&gt; If the fable is true, it would be against all superstition to ignore it. The men ignore the squawked orders of their superiors and begin muttering among themselves how best to catch the mermaid's attention. When one grabs hold of the wheel to change course, it is clear things have got out of hand. The bo'sun, finding this challenge to authority thoroughly unacceptable, brandishes the whip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802293">Have the sailors flogged</Text>
  <Text ID="802294">&lt;b&gt;The sailors grumble back to their posts.&lt;/b&gt; Resorting to such primitive naval discipline has left a bit if a bad atmosphere, but you doubt it will last forever. Besides, the bos'un only gave them a very gentle bruising— anything more than that is frowned upon these days. At least those silly thoughts of mermaids have been well and truly banished.</Text>
  <Text ID="802295">&lt;b&gt;What you have done is illegal,&lt;/b&gt; and the crew have no difficulty making their displeasure known. After the bo'sun has beaten a man's back to a pulp, the crew gather on the top deck, where the cries of the mermaid can still be heard, although it sounds like weeping now. "That act was outlawed a half century ago. We hereby notify you of our forthcoming testimony against the bo'sun in court of law, that is, if we ever manage to return." Morale aboard stoops to a new low. </Text>
  <Text ID="802296">Drop the issue and let them be</Text>
  <Text ID="802297">&lt;b&gt;Discipline aboard this ship is lax.&lt;/b&gt; Convinced that their misconduct can go unpunished, the sailors take to negotiating, and even outright ignoring the tedious instructions of officers. The use of "mermaid" as a keyword becomes synonymous with this rebellious undercurrent which is sure to blight the rest of the voyage.</Text>
  <Text ID="802381">Call Of The Devil</Text>
  <Text ID="802382">&lt;b&gt;Can it be the voice of a child this deep in the jungle?&lt;/b&gt; The expedition has taken a couple of days sojourn inland, looking for citrus to save them from scurvy. Taking shelter during a particularly heavy cloudburst, they are sure they can hear children's voices through the pitter-patter of rain. Your men strain to see where it may be coming from. "It is Lucifer, of cloven hoof, leading us astray!" whispers the priest, "pay him no heed!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802383">Let your zoologist speak</Text>
  <Text ID="802386">&lt;b&gt;"Hush you insufferable fool, it is a marvellous species of talking bird!"&lt;/b&gt; exclaims the zoologist. Following a trail of excrement on the rainforest floor, the zoologist soon finds a colourful feather. "Raaawwwk!" splutters something in the trees above. The expedition crane their necks up to find the most colourful avian peering sidelong down at them. The specimen is duly captured for the benefit of the natural sciences.</Text>
  <Text ID="802384">Ignore the devil voices</Text>
  <Text ID="802387">&lt;b&gt;The sailors close their minds to the voices.&lt;/b&gt; With the stubborness of true believers, your crew convince themselves it is devil speak, repeating "I renounce him, his demons and his works!" Their faith is affirmed when the rain stops and the voices desist. Later that day they stumble across Eden; a thicket of Camucamu fruit trees. "Very tart indeed," says the doctor, "precisely what we've been wanting."</Text>
  <Text ID="802388">&lt;b&gt;The voices are too persistent for them to ignore.&lt;/b&gt; "I must know what they are!" one man cries, and the priest cannot seem to dissuade him or others from venturing from the shelter to seek them out. The further they go from the camp, the clearer the child-like chatter becomes. It feels inevitable something terrible is going to happen.</Text>
  <Text ID="802389">At least let the priest go ahead</Text>
  <Text ID="802391">&lt;b&gt;The priest's incantations subdue the Devil.&lt;/b&gt; The priest swats his flickering torch in front of the party, bellowing incessantly "God is my salvation, the Lord be my sword and shield!" mouth brimming with rainwater, until someone shakes him by the shoulder. He startles, but his comrade reassures him. "The voices have ceased! You have saved us— saved us from temptation!"  </Text>
  <Text ID="802392">&lt;b&gt;The devil noise drowns out the priest's prayer.&lt;/b&gt; As he anoints each sailor hastily with holy water, a voice identical to his screeches "Get away devil!", and raucous laughter erupts from the forest all around. Men and women run for dear life, only for the jungle to swallow them up. The ship feels very empty on the onward journey. "Led to the underworld," the Captain prods the disgraced priest in the chest, "by the agents of Lucifer!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802390">Run for the ocean</Text>
  <Text ID="802393">&lt;b&gt;The voices are gone, but the scurvy is terrible.&lt;/b&gt; Scarpering from the jungle, the crew leave all their supplies behind. In addition, the expedition has not found the vitamin-rich fruit it so badly needed. It will be several weeks before new land is sighted, and the crew's teeth and hair is already falling out.</Text>
  <Text ID="802385">Find a more rational explanation</Text>
  <Text ID="802394">&lt;b&gt;It is not children they have heard but birds!&lt;/b&gt; The hunters among the crew know it right away, signalling to the other to be quiet as they scan the trees for  the cacophonous culprits. Before too long one of the brightly-coloured beauties makes itself known. The hunters manage to capture it, and bring the little marvel back onboard for the benefit of the natural sciences.</Text>
  <Text ID="802395">&lt;b&gt;Fear incites a rash decision.&lt;/b&gt; The majority tremble in silence, as the eerie voice draws nearer still, except for one cocksure officer who jabs his pistol every which way, looking for something to shoot. Seeing movement among the trees he fires, only to see his bullet graze the shoulder of an indigenous girl, perhaps five or six years old. It is likely she has never come across the white devil before, and she disappears into the trees wailing. She will survive. The officer however is clutching his chest, he has had a heart attack, and dies. </Text>
  <Text ID="802397">The Treasure of&lt;br/&gt;Hassan Ben Sahid</Text>
  <Text ID="802398">&lt;b&gt;An old man claims to know the location of a great treasure.&lt;/b&gt; You have stopped over at a sandswept port. A gaggle of officers is enjoying sweet cardamom-infused coffee in the morning sun, when one of the other patrons approaches. He is old and blind, his clothes dirty. "I have need of adventurers like yourselves, for the treasure of the pirate Hassan Ben Sahid is here! It is just waiting to be found!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802399">Believe the old man and follow him</Text>
  <Text ID="802401">&lt;b&gt;He trusts you, and proffers a crinkled map of the town.&lt;/b&gt; It is annotated with an unusual script. "Take it! I cannot read it," he says swatting flies from his milky and crusted eyes, "but then, I never could solve it when I had my sight!" It turns out the only thing he is absolutely sure of, is that the treasure is hidden nearby.</Text>
  <Text ID="802403">Try to decode the map</Text>
  <Text ID="802405">&lt;b&gt;One of the officers makes the map talk.&lt;/b&gt; She is an educated woman, a graduate of a fine old university, who snuck into the navy by shaving her head. "Arabic," she says, "but here is written left to right, like a mirror image." It reads: &lt;br/&gt;"Hassan Ben Sahid breathes his last,&lt;br/&gt;Upon you these spoils fairly won,&lt;br/&gt;As I enter that lavish garden,&lt;br/&gt;may your own thirst be quenched."</Text>
  <Text ID="802407">Read it spiritually, go to the cemetery</Text>
  <Text ID="802409">&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; The cemetery is modest, just unmarked funeral stones jutting up from the dust. Each is pointing in the same direction. "We need not disturb the dead," your officer says, pointing to a lush grove of date palm, "for our thirst is quenched!" There, in its centre, is a working noria that might have been running for centuries. "Lower me down," she says. At the bottom of the well is the most extraordinary golden hoard! You go to thank the old blind man, but he has vanished...</Text>
  <Text ID="802410">&lt;b&gt;Your officers rigidly uphold their beliefs.&lt;b&gt; The old blind man leads you to the modest cemetery, a square of unmarked funeral stones jutting up from the dust. Each is pointing in the same direction. "We should not disturb the dead," the officers agree. There are simply too many stones, and know way of guessing which belonged to Ben Sahid. The crew return to the ship believing they have at least tried.</Text>
  <Text ID="802408">Read it literally and seek out a garden</Text>
  <Text ID="802411">&lt;b&gt;The treasure of Hassan Ben Sahid!&lt;/b&gt; "The map smells sickly sweet with something," says one keen-nosed officer, "dates perhaps!" After hunting around the officers come across a lush grove of date palm. "For our thirst is quenched!" they cry, for there in its centre, is a working noria that might have been running for centuries. One of them is lowered down to the bottom of the well, where they find the most extraordinary golden hoard! You go to thank the old blind man, but he has vanished...</Text>
  <Text ID="802412">&lt;b&gt;Though pleasant, the search is fruitless.&lt;/b&gt; There are many gardens between the arched babs of the old town, none any less sweet-scented or busy-with-bees than the last. The crew give up their efforts to find the spot where Ben Sahid's treasure lies buried, instead preferring the less tangible rewards of exploring a new and unfamiliar place.</Text>
  <Text ID="802406">&lt;b&gt;No-one can work out what the message says.&lt;/b&gt; "Looks a bit like Arabic?" offers one of the confused officers. The old blind man sighs a bitter sigh, snatches back his map, and departs. As the ship leaves port, rumours spread of the gold, sapphires and rubies that have been passed up. The crew can't help but feel disappointed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802404">Try to read the map</Text>
  <Text ID="802413">&lt;b&gt;A treasure cache!&lt;/b&gt; Matching the landmarks of the city to the crude objects depicted on the faded map, one thing in particular sticks out. "An old fort!" a smart young officer exclaims. The blind man follows the eager beagles in amusement, as they set off at a giddy clip. He knows the fort cannot where Ben Sahid's treasure is buried, since it belonged to a great enemy of his who came from the far north. It is nevertheless full of unclaimed riches!</Text>
  <Text ID="802414">&lt;b&gt;The map appears worthless without the annotations.&lt;/b&gt; "We could have just remained in that wonderful old square under that marvellous arched gate and sipped our coffee on this beautiful sunny day. Instead we have sweat our suspenders off on this childish treasure hunt! We have seen the whole city, and yet we have seen absolutely nothing at all!" So much for relaxing shore leave...</Text>
  <Text ID="802402">&lt;b&gt;The old man leads you into a trap!&lt;/b&gt; He chatters amiably all the way to a hammam— a steam bath— where he insists a descendant of Ben Sahid now works. Before they can realise how misplaced their trust in him was, your officers, naked and relieved of their weapons, are surrounded by a gang asking for payment.</Text>
  <Text ID="802415">Fight your way out</Text>
  <Text ID="802417">&lt;b&gt;It's a bit of a wrestling match.&lt;/b&gt; "How do you like that eh, sirrah!" blares your punchiest officer, emerging from the fight the victor, his adversary left gasping and bloody-nosed on the marble floor. "What do you think you are doing!" rages the proprietor of these fabulously frescoed baths, "this is a place of peace you have defiled!" So much for relaxing shore leave...</Text>
  <Text ID="802418">&lt;b&gt;An officer drowns in a sweat-filled bath.&lt;/b&gt; Punches are thrown in every direction, and no-one sees him hit his head. The thugs hold up their hands, "we never thought it would come to this," they say, when it is discovered he is dead. There is a sombre mood as he is carried back aboard ship, and the others have to explain how he came to such a bizarre end.</Text>
  <Text ID="802416">Give them what they want</Text>
  <Text ID="802419">They watch as your embarassed crew empty their pockets</Text>
  <Text ID="802420">Accept</Text>
  <Text ID="802422">&lt;b&gt;You trade various goods against safe passage.&lt;/b&gt; Not so much a trade as blackmail, your sailors feel the shame of ridicule as their clothes are returned. What kind of rational being believes in the existence of Ben Sahid's treasure, and permits a blind man to lead them to it!?</Text>
  <Text ID="802421">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802423">&lt;b&gt;Your men offer far too little,&lt;/b&gt; so the bathhouse thugs help themselves to it all anyway. Their ringleader, the old man who led your treasure-seeking officers here, turns out not to be blind at all. He gives your officers something rather less pleasant than a massage until they agree to write a note ordering supplies be released from the ship's hold. Once the exchange has been made, your shame-faced officers are finally allowed to go free.</Text>
  <Text ID="802400">Decline the promise of riches</Text>
  <Text ID="802424">&lt;b&gt;Fantasies of pirate treasure belong to another century.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew ignores the blind man, who becomes rather angry and beats the backs of the officers with his fists. The officers pity him, and do not try to retaliate. Eventually he hobbles off, muttering to himself. As the ship leaves port, rumours spread of the gold, sapphires and rubies that have been passed up. The crew can't help but feel disappointed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802426">Too Good To Be True?</Text>
  <Text ID="802427">&lt;b&gt;A delicious-looking banquet, with no-one around to eat it!&lt;/b&gt; Rising smoke encourages the crew to put to shore, but upon their arrival, they find the hamlet of conical stone huts to be deserted. Nevertheless, after months on jerky and biscuits, the sight of the fresh fish, cassava, and banana wrapped in banana leaves that has been left out has the crew salivating! "It's too good to be true!" a sage old sailor warns.</Text>
  <Text ID="802428">Heed the old sailor's warning</Text>
  <Text ID="802431">&lt;b&gt;The expedition have absolute faith in his words.&lt;/b&gt; "We may be allowed to eat, if we appease the spirit of this fair glen," the old sailor croons, gesturing at a stone marked with white chalk, that appears to have fallen on its side. The crew have absolute faith in his words. "That is what mother told me of fairy circles, and I never knew her to be wrong..."</Text>
  <Text ID="802434">Study the chalk spirit on the stone</Text>
  <Text ID="802437">&lt;b&gt;Your crew study the chalk symbol with due reverence.&lt;/b&gt; It has three points like an arrowhead, and the smiling face of a deity at its centre. The crew interpret the slight angle of this triangle as a sign, since it points roughly towards a distant and cloud-wreathed peak. </Text>
  <Text ID="802439">Let your anthropologist piece the clues together</Text>
  <Text ID="802442">&lt;b&gt;Your men are soon enjoying every hospitality.&lt;/b&gt; "It is a three-pointed zemi," the anthropologist says excitedly. "The inhabitants of this village have departed to the mountain yonder, to thank the spirit for a plentiful harvest." Your men put away their weapons, and sit cross-legged by the stone awaiting their return. The locals are surprised and afraid to have foreign visitors, but sensing only good intentions, invite you to their hearty feast. The chief enjoys your company greatly, and insists you take an amulet and bananas as a parting gift.</Text>
  <Text ID="802440">Follow the arrow towards the mountain</Text>
  <Text ID="802443">&lt;b&gt;Your men are soon enjoying every hospitality.&lt;/b&gt; You are following the trail when your sharp-eyed scout remarks "The villagers return from the mountain, they are armed with nothing but palm leaves". You await them in the open, making sure to keep any weapons out of sight. The locals are surprised and afraid to have visitors, but as this is an auspicious day, they invite you to a hearty feast. The chief enjoys the company of your knowledgeable woodsmen greatly, and insists you take an amulet and bananas as a parting gift.</Text>
  <Text ID="802444">&lt;b&gt;Your crew find some bananas at least.&lt;/b&gt; You are following the trail when your scout says in agitation, "the villagers return from the mountain, they are carrying fearsome weapons". Heeding the scout's worries, the crew detour through a banana grove, where they stock up on the fruit and return to the ship. Later, upon hearing the scout's description of the weapons, some crew members begin to wonder they might not just have been the branches of a royal palm...</Text>
  <Text ID="802441">Leave while you still can</Text>
  <Text ID="802445">&lt;b&gt;The expedition is content to gather its own food.&lt;/b&gt; Leaving the strange village and its untouched banquet behind, the crew soon encounter a banana grove. "A fitting reward for our having left the spirits of that village undisturbed," the old sailor says with a satisfied air, evidently in favour of the rather pious restraint your people have shown in this place.</Text>
  <Text ID="802438">&lt;b&gt;"It's just a child's drawing,"&lt;/b&gt; is the cynical analysis offered by the ship's quartermaster, which no-one else has sufficient conviction to debate. "And what's it got to do with whether we eat that food or not?" Spiritual nourishment seems to be the last thing on the minds of your crew...they return to the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802435">Lift the ritual stone back up</Text>
  <Text ID="802446">&lt;b&gt;Back in its correct position,&lt;/b&gt; the chalk symbol looks like an arrow pointing towards a distant mountain. Showing their fine physical condition, your men lift the stone on a count of three. It must weigh a ton, but still, they make short work of it. The symbol is a three-pointed star, with a face in its midst, which seems to the trackers to suggest the direction in which the villagers must have departed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802447">&lt;b&gt;The statue won't budge.&lt;/b&gt; As many men as hands can fit around the slab attempt to resurrect it, but to no avail. "And what's it got to do with whether we eat that food or not?" pipes up one of your scrawny soldiers. Spiritual nourishment seems to be the last thing on the minds of your crew...</Text>
  <Text ID="802436">Leave while you still can</Text>
  <Text ID="802451">&lt;b&gt;The expedition is content to gather its own food.&lt;/b&gt; Leaving the strange village and its untouched banquet behind, the crew soon encounter a banana grove. "A fitting reward for our having left the spirits of that village undisturbed," the old sailor says with a satisfied air, evidently in favour of the rather pious restraint your people have shown in this place.</Text>
  <Text ID="802432">&lt;b&gt;They should have had more faith in the old sailor.&lt;/b&gt; Taking his words with a pinch of salt, your men swarm the miraculous banquet, turning the food over in their hands, as if to divine if it is real or not. Before anyone can take a bite however, &lt;b&gt;the villagers reappear looking rather cheesed off.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802452">Food fight!</Text>
  <Text ID="802454">&lt;b&gt;A greedy but profitable raid.&lt;/b&gt; Neither side wants to die for a picnic, and so come at each other with whatever they can find; palm branches, rocks, handfuls of dirt, even. Needless to say, the scuffle is a very odd spectacle indeed, but eventually results in the villagers fleeing into the forest. The feast meanwhile has been almost entirely trampled and smeared into the raffia matting on which it had been laid out, but the crew do manage to pillage a few hands of bananas found in a store hut.</Text>
  <Text ID="802455">&lt;b&gt;Too awful to be true.&lt;/b&gt; As the villagers rush, your men fire wildly, before realising they are both unarmed and intent only on recovering their food. One of them is hit— a woman. There is nothing your medics can do for her. The sense of shame is only compounded on return to the ship, when a group of your men are found to have stolen supplies belonging to the villagers, in spite of everything. Your expedition can barely look one another in the eye. </Text>
  <Text ID="802453">Try to apologise</Text>
  <Text ID="802456">&lt;b&gt;Your people are very diplomatic.&lt;/b&gt; Immediately stepping away from the feast, they raise their hands above them and offer a few reassuring words that no harm was meant. The villagers lower their weapons. Though they seem disgruntled at your invasion of their home and ritual, their chief offers you a generous quantity of bananas to wish you peacefully on your way.</Text>
  <Text ID="802457">&lt;b&gt;Your expedition leaves safe, but hungry.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers stare, silent and disapproving, as your men raise their hands slowly and back away. As the expedition boards ship, the captain raises a spyglass to the village, high up the lush green valley. He can see the villagers still watching, waiting, until they are sure the thieves are gone.</Text>
  <Text ID="802458">&lt;b&gt;Your expedition leaves both hungry and several men lighter. &lt;/b&gt; Not only have your men descrated the feast in honour of the spirit of cassava, they remain unapologetic, poking and prodding the different dishes as if the villagers weren't even there. When one man takes a carved ritual spoon and starts digging in, smiling as he does so, he seems surprised when a villager shoots him. A brief exchange of gunfire follows, before your men flee to avoid taking further losses.</Text>
  <Text ID="802433">&lt;b&gt;Your band of fools mock the old sailor.&lt;/b&gt; "Old wives tales!" they guffaw, savaging the feast like locusts, stuffing their mouths with a fervour that would be unthinkable back home. But when one of them suddenly turns pale, realisation dawns on the others— the food is poisoned! Who did this? Why? All your crew survive, but the poisoning is very serious, and requires weeks of recuperation before your crew is ready to depart this cursed place.</Text>
  <Text ID="802429">Scan about for danger</Text>
  <Text ID="802461">&lt;b&gt;A watchful lookout spots the enemy before they attack.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossesed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for pirates and brigands. Forewarned is forearmed, and the crew stage a small ambush of their own. You bait the curs out before overpowering them, and taking all the food and supplies they have.</Text>
  <Text ID="802462">&lt;b&gt;The command to go ahead and eat is given in error.&lt;/b&gt; The lookout has just given the all clear, when she spots the inhabitants of the village rushing in from all sides.</Text>
  <Text ID="802463">&lt;b&gt;The savage bandits find the expedition before it can find them.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossesed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for scoundrels. They whoop and holler from the trees and descend upon a few valiant defenders as the rest of the expedition turns and flee for the ship. </Text>
  <Text ID="802430">Grab the food and run</Text>
  <Text ID="802468">&lt;b&gt;It's a trap, of course.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as one of the sailors touches the cassava, a hooting resonates around the village. It seems the indigenous people who built these huts were dispossesed of them long ago, and that they now serve as a refuge for pirates and brigands. As soon as there is gunfire, your sailors scatter in a panic and flee to the ship, empty-handed and badly wounded.</Text>
  <Text ID="802546">Apostasy</Text>
  <Text ID="802547">&lt;b&gt;The crew need some common ground.&lt;/b&gt; It is a fact that your crew were recruited regardless of their origins or beliefs, and your officers now wonder if this was a mistake. After weeks of lasting rainstorms, the more devout sailors raise their voice: this constant punishment is testimony to His obvious displeasure at the heresy aboard. Something is wanted to bring believers and apostates together before things get out of hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="802550">Consult the Norse Sagas</Text>
  <Text ID="802556">&lt;b&gt;The Old Norse has much wisdom to share.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Men brave and generous live the best lives, seldom will they sorrow; then there are fools, afraid of everything, who grumble instead of giving.”&lt;br/&gt;The Sæmundar Edda serves as a gentle reminder to your sailors that their grievances are shallow and foolish. Having heard the Captain quote it the previous evening, the crew awake with open hearts and minds. And what's more, the sun is shining again. </Text>
  <Text ID="802549">Consult the Song of Odysseus</Text>
  <Text ID="802557">&lt;b&gt;The Odyssey's wisdom seeps into your sailors' souls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"For a friend with an understanding heart is worth no less than a brother."&lt;br/&gt;The sailors can't help but compare this tale of cameraderie with their own quest, adventures and misadventures. Having heard the Captain quote it the previous evening, the crew awake with open hearts and minds. And what's more, the sun is shining again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802548">Consult the Song of Ilion</Text>
  <Text ID="802558">&lt;b&gt;The Iliad's wisdom seeps into your sailors' souls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Come then, let us give each other glorious presents, so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us: 'These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then joined with each other in close friendship.'"&lt;br/&gt;Hector's speech reminds your sailors of the things they do have in common, rather than those they don't. Having heard the Captain quote it the previous evening, the crew awake with open hearts and minds. And what's more, the sun is shining again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802553">Consult Skaldic poetry</Text>
  <Text ID="802559">&lt;b&gt;The epic poem puts your crew's petty bickering in perspective.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The battle continued from day to day; and all they who fell, and all the swords that lay on the field of battle, and all the shields, became stone."&lt;br/&gt;The crew themselves are petrified as they hang on the captain's every word. It's a bit of a saga, but they emerge the next morning to blue skies and fair winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="802552">Consult an ancient romance</Text>
  <Text ID="802560">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors bond over the bizarre love story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“There was never any yet that wholly could escape love, and never shall there be any, never so long as beauty shall be, never so long as eyes can see."&lt;br/&gt;The Captain closes, leaving the crew to ponder the fate of Daphnis and Chloe, and all the goats. Even the zealots crack a few bawdy jokes, and all emerge the next morning to blue skies and fair winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="802551">Consult ancient myth</Text>
  <Text ID="802561">&lt;b&gt;All are enchanted by the Book of the Dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A speculative translation of the Ptolemaic illustrations leaves the whole crew weighing their own hearts. Regardless of their beliefs, your crew share dreams of Anubis and his scales, and the mysterious spells that may transport one to the underworld Duat, to meet Osiris. All emerge next morning to blue skies and fair winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="802554">Encourage the apostates to have faith</Text>
  <Text ID="802562">&lt;b&gt;A message of forgiveness relieves the tension.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate. He will never abandon you, even if you have abandoned him."&lt;br/&gt;The priest speaks to a common morality, the universal lessons of kindness to your fellows, love conquering all, et cetera. The anger of those with other beliefs, or none at all, softens enough so that everyone can get on with expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="802563">&lt;b&gt;The priest further inflames those in opposition.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"If your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' your hand shall be first against him to put him to death!"&lt;br/&gt;Needless to say, the tensions that a few kind words might so easily have relieved, now threaten to sabotage your expedition. </Text>

God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere,"&lt;br/&gt; quotes the former barrister, setting aside her own particular beliefs for the greater good.

  <Text ID="802565">&lt;b&gt;The diplomat makes things worse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion!"&lt;br/&gt;A line of argument both insulting, and untrue, since the clergymen aboard only stand to receive a small church stipend for their efforts. "Faithless lot! We do not do this for greed as you so plainly do!" Needless to say, the tensions that a few careful words might so easily have relieved, now threaten to sabotage your expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="803274">The Haunted Castle</Text>
  <Text ID="803275">&lt;b&gt;"A-Anyone home...?"&lt;/b&gt; Seeking refuge from a thunderstorm, your people dash for the tumbledown castle. Lightning exposes its stark towers, barred windows and the solemn stone gryphons either side of the gate. As the last of your party crosses the threshold, an iron portcullis drops and clangs shut behind them! Despite their best efforts, your men cannot seem to raise it. The castle and its courtyard appear empty, but there is a sense that someone —or something— has been expecting you.</Text>
  <Text ID="803276">Cry out that you come in peace</Text>
  <Text ID="803277">&lt;b&gt;The officer refuses to give in to his fear,&lt;/b&gt; but calls steadily "We mean no harm, we only seek refuge from the storm!" As if by magic, the great door of the castle creaks open. Your men accept the invitation to shelter, but with palpably less enthusiasm than would be customary on a night such as this. Inside, a once-opulent dining hall greets them, its few flickering candles burned down to a nub. But the attention of the crew is frozen upon the head of the long table, where &lt;b&gt;a vaporous woman appears to be hovering several feet in the air!&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="803278">Refuse to believe it is real</Text>
  <Text ID="803301">&lt;b&gt;"It must be a trick,&lt;/b&gt; for most certainly is not real!" says a young woman, who rushes forward, hand raised towards the figure. Just as she is about to touch it, it vanishes. "There is a glass here...a mirror!" she exclaims. "Please!" A dimunitive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!" Relief turns to wonder, as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he has created for the illusion. "Permit me to make it up to you!" he beams, flipping a switch and filling the hall with electric light. "Geoffery," he calls up to the rafters, "Inform the cooks we shall have guests tonight!" </Text>
  <Text ID="803302">&lt;b&gt;"Disbelieve your eyes...!"&lt;/b&gt; The unconvincing advice only serves to startle the crew even further. The moment one of the crew plucks up the courage to take a forward step, the apparition abruptly vanishes. "What manner of horror is it that we all have just witnessed? I will not stay here a moment longer," he says. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard mysteriously returned to the raised position, your crew take this chance to make a run for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="803303">&lt;b&gt;"It-it cannot be...!"&lt;/b&gt; An officer's hand quavers towards the apparition, but the faceless woman mirrors him, pointing her claw-fingered as if to single him out. At this, everybody dashes for the entrance screaming, trampling and shoving one another. Finding the portcullis in the courtyard mysteriously returned to the raised position, your spooked crew take this chance to make a run for it. The portcullis falls. None but that marked man is crushed under its weight.</Text>
  <Text ID="803279">Shoot at the apparition</Text>
  <Text ID="803280">&lt;b&gt;The ghostly dinner guest shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a glass angled to reflect an old mannequin! "Please!" A dimunitive and smartly-dressed man emerges from the shadows, hands aloft, "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this is my latest invention!" Relief turns to wonder, as they marvel at the life-like mannequin he has created for the illusion. "Permit me to make it up to you!" he beams, flipping a switch and filling the hall with electric light. "Geoffery," he calls up to the rafters, "Inform the cooks we shall have guests tonight!" </Text>
  <Text ID="803281">&lt;b&gt;Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!"&lt;/b&gt; "Patricia!...Patricia!" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to cut the fine cat-gut strings that hold her in mid-air, "oh lord! Whatever have you done sirs!" She will die in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their good judgement. They depart into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.</Text>
  <Text ID="803282">&lt;b&gt;The first mate's tremulous voice returns no answer&lt;/b&gt; but its own echo, somehow distorted and corrupted by the castle walls. Can it be, that whatever now inhabits this place, no longer has the power to speak? Or perhaps it is merely biding its time...</Text>
  <Text ID="803283">Look for a way out</Text>
  <Text ID="803284">&lt;b&gt;There is a way over the walls!&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stair is found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. Through a maze of shadowy rooms, and hallways, lit only by the occasional flash, the crew discovers a staircase to the third floor. From there they emerge to the wall, and descend the dark and lush ivy on its exterior, welcoming the feel of the pouring rain, from which they had so recently sought to hide.</Text>
  <Text ID="803285">&lt;b&gt;This castle was clearly designed to keep people in.&lt;/b&gt; Strangely, no ladder or stair is found leading up to the high battlements, but the upper part of the keep appears attached. But after what feels like hours wandering the laberinthine corridors of the keep, a peculiar door swings open. It appears to lead to a master bedroom. A soft, plaintive song rises from within, where a young woman is found at her mirror. She sits combing her hair, her bridal dress soiled and torn, and her face impossibly pale.</Text>
  <Text ID="803286">Refuse to believe she is real</Text>
  <Text ID="803287">&lt;b&gt;Faith steadies the soldier's hand as he approaches the bride,&lt;/b&gt; but then he stops abruptly. "You should see your faces!" cackles a dimunitive and smartly-dressed man, emerging from the shadows. Suddenly the room fills with electric light. "I'm Jean-Eugène Poivre, and this little beauty is my proudest invention." He winks and twists the bride's head one-hundred and eighty degrees. The automaton is in so lifelike, it chills your men even now. They do not take well to learning the illusionist has been toying with them, and leave early the following morning, still very upset.</Text>
  <Text ID="803288">&lt;b&gt;Their faith cannot prepare them for this.&lt;/b&gt; Her head suddenly spins on its axis, its face not young and pale as in the mirror, but shrunken and grey— a thousand-years old!— it's empty eyeholes seething with a colony of larvae! The sailors run. Rushing through the dark dark halls, trampling the rickety stairs, and out into the rain. Finding the portcullis raised, they rush for the beyond; a lifetime of insomnia.</Text>
  <Text ID="803289">Shoot at the apparition</Text>
  <Text ID="803290">&lt;b&gt;The phantom bride shatters!&lt;/b&gt; It was just a glass, angled to reflect a mannequin in a hidden alcove. A small man storms from the shadows. "Who do you think you are, destroying my precious illusion?" he screams. "Have you any idea how much effort, not to mention expense, I had invested in this single piece of glass, the lifelike skin of my mannequin you have pierced with your bullets! Get away from this place, get away!" Your people trudge out into the rain.</Text>
  <Text ID="803291">&lt;b&gt;Horror! The bullet passes through flesh and blood!"&lt;/b&gt; "Patricia!...Patricia!" wails the illusionist, as he rushes from the wings to be beside the actress; his dying wife, "oh lord! Whatever have you done sirs!" Shortly after, she dies in his arms. That your soldiers were duped by a bit of make-up and a costume doesn't say much for their judgement. The expedition leaves the poor man and his tragic theatre set, and departs into the rain, which seems to fall harder and louder than ever before.</Text>
  <Text ID="803292">Try again to force the gates</Text>
  <Text ID="803293">&lt;b&gt;Success!&lt;/b&gt; Under the weight of the sailors' immense strength, the portcullis is raised the fraction needed to get everyone sliding beneath. It takes good teamwork on the far side to get the last stragglers under, shelterless but free of this nightmarish place. </Text>
  <Text ID="803294">&lt;b&gt;It's useless.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone tries their best, but they simply don't have the strength. Two men strain their shoulders and but still the portcullis cannot be raised an inch. Someone notices a cable leading from the top of the barbican where the portcullis is held, up to a high window of the keep.</Text>
  <Text ID="803295">Try to scale the walls instead</Text>
  <Text ID="803296">&lt;b&gt;Finally free of this nightmare!&lt;/b&gt; The sailors are able to help each other up to the battlements, despite the interior walls of the castle being smooth and featureless— it's almost as if they had been designed to keep people in... Once they have clambered down the ivy on the other side of the thick walls, your expedition party look for somewhere safer to sleep, if it's not too cold and wet that is.</Text>
  <Text ID="803297">&lt;b&gt;Only the able-bodied make it.&lt;/b&gt; The interior walls of the castle are smooth and featureless— it's almost as if they had been designed to keep people in... When the skilled climbers reach the battlements do they realise there is no easy way to help the rest up. "We'll come back for you in the morning," they say. Returning after a damp and sleepless night, they find the portcullis raised yet see no sign of their comrades. A thorough search of the castle is conducted, but the devil place is found to be completely deserted.</Text>
  <Text ID="803298">Shelter in the castle courtyard</Text>
  <Text ID="803299">&lt;b&gt;It's a foul night in the rain.&lt;/b&gt; There is minimal shelter from the elements within these smooth and featureless walls, and the rising moan of the gale is unbearable. Finally at dawn, the storm relents. At about half past the hour of ten, the castle door swings open, and a friendly-faced man emerges from it. "What in blazes!" he laughs, "what are all you fellows doing out here!" He explains that he is the heir to this castle, which he claims survived a siege in 1422, and that the portcullis is a rather sensitive beast these days. Your men are pretty peeved, not to mention a little feverish, at the thought they could have spent the night in a comfortable four-poster bed.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800467">Love Island</Text>
  <Text ID="800468">&lt;b&gt;A matter of the heart.&lt;/b&gt; The crew have been enjoying some island hospitality, but many are now refusing to leave. They have fallen in love with the sons and daughters of the local king. Perhaps he can be convinced to allow them to come with you? You can attempt to come to an arrangement, or else wait for him to consult his copper oracle.</Text>
  <Text ID="800470">Offer a wedding gift</Text>
  <Text ID="800474">&lt;b&gt;The king is not only surprised,&lt;/b&gt; but moved to tears by the romantic composers he hears via the gramophone. He insists on a grand banquet to celebrate the union of his children and your crew. Both traditional music and a few cranks of the newfangled gramophone accompany the beautiful ceremony, and then its bon voyage!</Text>
  <Text ID="800471">Convince the king your crew's affection is genuine</Text>
  <Text ID="800475">&lt;b&gt;The king is delighted to see his children wed.&lt;/b&gt; Delicate understanding of local custom and a smattering of their language allow a message of true love to be conveyed. The king evidently thinks his children in good hands. Feasting, and to the amusement of all, terrible dancing, follows. For his departing children, it shall be the longest, most fascinating honeymoon. </Text>
  <Text ID="800476">&lt;b&gt;Something is lost in translation.&lt;/b&gt; Yet the king smiles benignly, as if your crew still have a chance to prove themselves. "He suggests a great hunt," says your diplomat, "or else we may await arcane judgment." His eyes flick to a copper oracle on a dais.</Text>
  <Text ID="800478">Capture the king a prize animal</Text>
  <Text ID="800480">&lt;b&gt;The hunt goes quite well.&lt;/b&gt; Beautiful boars inhabit the woods, and though tricky to catch, are little trouble for your experts. Though the king will still not allow you to leave with his children, the feast of boar brings everyone together in the moment. The lovers understand this moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways. </Text>
  <Text ID="800481">&lt;b&gt;The hunt is not perfect.&lt;/b&gt; The crew show courage in pursuit of a tiger, which draws the king's admiration. Sadly, they cannot catch it, which leaves the king wondering if your men will be able to provide once married. Thus, he decides not to let his children leave. Some of your crew remain committed to staying behind, and it is with regret you must continue without them.</Text>
  <Text ID="800482">&lt;b&gt;Your naive hunters fail the test.&lt;/b&gt; Forest deer are everywhere, and hunting them hardly seems a challenge. Had your so-named "hunters" any respect for nature, they'd have realised the sacred deer were not what the king was after. Instead they gather them up greedily. The king makes it perfectly clear your expedition must move on. With heavy hearts, the sailors return to the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="800479">Face the verdict of the copper oracle</Text>
  <Text ID="800483">&lt;b&gt;The oracle predicts a reassuring fate for all.&lt;/b&gt; Those who wish to remain for love will live fulfilling lives, but the same shall be true for those still committed to your expedition. All parties feel a sense of peace. Your voyage shall continue without any resentment towards those it leaves behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="800484">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle is disappointingly undecided.&lt;/b&gt; The king cannot, in good faith, allow his children to leave to an uncertain destiny. His ultimatum is that your crew become part of his extensive family or else they must leave alone. Though understandable, it is nevertheless regrettable when some decide to stay behind.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800485">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle predicts that your souls cannot be saved.&lt;/b&gt; With your crew rotten to the core, the king makes it clear there can be no union with his children, and that you are no longer welcome. Heart-broken and bearing the burden of sin, the crew return to the triviality of duty.</Text>
  <Text ID="800477">&lt;b&gt;The awkward gestures and diagrams in the sand&lt;/b&gt; prove highly offensive to the king and his people. Sensing outrage, the crew back away towards the ship. The angry locals fire arrows at their former amours. Fittingly, one is struck in the heart, and bleeds out into the brine. The rest return lovelorn, to their dreary maps and compasses.</Text>
  <Text ID="800472">Await the verdict of the copper oracle</Text>
  <Text ID="800486">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle sees only purity in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; It predicts a bounteous future for the king's children, and so with tearful pride, he gives the couples his blessing. The traditional ceremony is both spiritually uplifting and wholesome.</Text>
  <Text ID="800487">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals a little doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king interprets that his children will only be happy if they remain on the island., and that some of your sailors are not in love, but merely infatuated. Still, you must lose the fine crew who have formed genuine bonds.</Text>
  <Text ID="800488">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle reveals great doubt in your crew's hearts.&lt;/b&gt; The king does not for a minute believe that your inconstant crew are as deep in love as they claim. If they cannot demonstrate otherwise, it might be better if your people left.</Text>
  <Text ID="800490">Try to convince the king your crew is worthy</Text>
  <Text ID="800492">&lt;b&gt;Careful diplomacy has him thinking twice.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps there is a way for the crew to prove themselves. A lean champion steps forward. Fighting him may impress the king, or else you can try and outhunt him.</Text>
  <Text ID="800494">Propose a contest of champions</Text>
  <Text ID="800496">&lt;b&gt;You have your champions.&lt;/b&gt; One-by-one the suitors fight the king's champion. Those who prevail, it turns out, are permitted to take their lovers to sea. Some fail, but can at least drown their sorrows during the farewell celebration that follows.</Text>
  <Text ID="800497">&lt;b&gt;It is not a pleasant sight for the faint of heart.&lt;/b&gt; Your best champion is put forward, and subsequently knocked about the head for the entirety of the contest. At the end a cloth is needed to conceal the disfigured face. The king expresses his condolences for your loss, but all is fair in love and war.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800495">Propose a hunting competition</Text>
  <Text ID="800498">&lt;b&gt;It is close but the king's champion is outfoxed.&lt;/b&gt; By sundown your best hunter has claimed six boars to their five. The king will still not allow you to leave with his children, but the feast of boar brings everyone together in one moment. The lovers understand a moment is all they have, and the next morning there is an acceptance that it is time to part ways. </Text>
  <Text ID="800499">&lt;b&gt;Lacking the skill, your hunters try to cheat.&lt;/b&gt; Without knowledge of the island's fauna, they decide to follow the king's hunters in the hope of poaching the animal they are tracking. But they are led a merry dance. Three days pass, and your champion is missing presumed dead. The crew have no choice but to depart, tail between their legs.</Text>
  <Text ID="800493">&lt;b&gt;The king is offended by your insolence.&lt;/b&gt; Without a word he boards a boat and heads out to sea. Some foolishly follow, believing he can be reasoned with, but they have even less knowledge of local boats than local customs. Their bodies will be dredged from the reef as your tactless expedition struggles on.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800491">Order the crew to leave at once</Text>
  <Text ID="800500">&lt;b&gt;Paradise lost!&lt;/b&gt; The expedition may be back underway, but the mood is abject as the beautiful island becomes but painful memory. Too painful for one, who is discovered dead, it is said, by way of a broken heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="800489">&lt;b&gt;The copper oracle proclaims your crew's hearts sinful and wicked.&lt;/b&gt; Arm-in-arm with their new-found amours, the sailors await some happy answer. But the moment the king's arm is raised, daggers unsheathe, plunging into the hearts of the would-be lovers. Speechless and unharmed, the rest are free to leave the island, pondering the grave cost of faithlessness.</Text>
  <Text ID="800473">Leave without the crew who've fallen in love</Text>
  <Text ID="800501">&lt;b&gt;It is a significant blow.&lt;/b&gt; Any happiness the crew might feel at their comrades finding love is consumed by feelings of resentment. How could they have been so selfish? The expedition goes on, but those who are still a part must take on twice as much work.</Text>
  <Text ID="800112">Temple of the Monkey God</Text>
  <Text ID="800114">&lt;b&gt;With water supplies so low&lt;/b&gt;, the sight of an island waterfall elicits a mighty cheer from the crew. But up close, high temple walls adorned with monkeys shield access to the water, and the temple entrance is obstructed by a crowd of devotees, deep in ritual.</Text>
  <Text ID="800115">Have [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] shed light on the meaning of the ritual</Text>
  <Text ID="800120">&lt;b&gt;'Nothing to fear from this ritual,'&lt;/b&gt; beams the anthropologist, having consulted a bound volume entitled "Creed of the Monkey God". 'If I am correct, the devotees gather to disperse the malefic spirit of envy. It would be excellent form for us to join in.' At which remark, the crew begin to look a little hesitant.</Text>
  <Text ID="800121">Join the ritual</Text>
  <Text ID="800123">&lt;b&gt;Sure enough, the ritual unfolds into a jolly dance.&lt;/b&gt; With the shaking of rainsticks, and gentle swaying must come broad smiles, for this is how the monkey himself defeated the spirit of envy. A feast of grouse and soursop follows, and [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] is presented a monkey-tooth amulet as a gift. Next morning, fresh water is collected from the waterfall and having waved goodbye, the happy crew set sail.</Text>
  <Text ID="800122">Just ask to get some water</Text>
  <Text ID="800124">&lt;b&gt;[AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] negotiates the much needed-water&lt;/b&gt;, through a lengthy exchange of sound and gesture, not all of which the crew can be certain is relevant. Having collected the water, the crew are content to leave the unanswered mysteries of the Temple of the Monkey God behind them.</Text>
  <Text ID="800116">Have the first mate convince the devotees to let you through</Text>
  <Text ID="800125">&lt;b&gt;The first mate does enough&lt;/b&gt; to persuade the locals - with flamboyant intimations of the hands - that the crew should be allowed to pass. Once water has been collected from the waterfall, the crew are able to put the adventure behind them.</Text>
  <Text ID="800126">&lt;b&gt;The first mate cannot make himself understood&lt;/b&gt;, despite employing the most outlandish gestures. The constant waving of the hands and legs unsettles the local people and there is suddenly an air of tension.</Text>
  <Text ID="800127">Have your men threaten them</Text>
  <Text ID="800130">&lt;b&gt;The men seem slightly uneasy.&lt;/b&gt; Still they charge, and the locals do disperse, clearing the way to the waterfall. But long after the water is refilled, and the ship has sailed, the crew have nightmares in which vengeful monkeys bedevil them for defiling their sacred temple.</Text>
  <Text ID="800132">&lt;b&gt;Before the sorry men can ready their weapons&lt;/b&gt; the devotees have attacked, and yet more rush from the undergrowth. The party desperately dashes for the ship, but several are skewered in a rain of javelins, each hilted with the howling visage of the Monkey God.</Text>
  <Text ID="800128">Stay calm, and offer them a deal instead</Text>
  <Text ID="800658">The locals look expectant</Text>
  <Text ID="800659">Deal</Text>
  <Text ID="800133">&lt;b&gt;The local people are spellbound by your offer.&lt;/b&gt; They invite you enthusiastically to join their ritual.</Text>
  <Text ID="800135">Join the ritual</Text>
  <Text ID="800137">&lt;b&gt;The ritual unfolds into a jolly dance.&lt;/b&gt; With the shaking of rainsticks, and gentle swaying must come broad smiles, for this is how the temple's monkey god defeated the spirit of envy. A feast of grouse and soursop follows, and as a celebration of trade and friendship, a monkey-tooth amulet is given the men as a gift. Next morning, fresh water is collected from the waterfall and having waved goodbye, the happy crew set sail.</Text>
  <Text ID="800136">Just ask to get some water</Text>
  <Text ID="800138">&lt;b&gt;Water goes without saying,&lt;/b&gt; seems to be the message from the enterprising devotees, who aren't offended the crew won't participate, but seem now to want to resume their ritual. The crew return to the ship, leaving the unanswered mysteries of the Temple of the Monkey God behind them.</Text>
  <Text ID="800660">No Deal</Text>
  <Text ID="800134">&lt;b&gt;The locals are at first interested,&lt;/b&gt; but the foremost of them, clad in monkey skins and wearing a linen monkey mask begins scolding his peers, violently knocking offers from their hands with a monkey-pommeled stick. All parties are now just as agitated as before.</Text>
  <Text ID="800139">Have your men threaten them</Text>
  <Text ID="800141">&lt;b&gt;The men seem slightly uneasy.&lt;/b&gt; Still they charge, and the monkey-mask and his devotees do disperse, clearing the way to the waterfall. But after the water is refilled, and the ship sailed, one of the crew reports nightmares in which vengeful monkeys bedevil him for defiling the sacred temple.</Text>
  <Text ID="800142">&lt;b&gt;Before the sorry men can ready their weapons&lt;/b&gt; monkey-mask has led an attack, and yet more devotees rush from the undergrowth. The men desperately dash for the ship, but several are skewered in a rain of javelins, each hilted with the howling visage of the Monkey God.</Text>
  <Text ID="800140">Have your men retreat to the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800143">&lt;b&gt;Your crew run fearfully&lt;/b&gt; from the temple where the devotees stand so firm. The monkey-masked one is heard uttering hard and undecipherable words that many of the crew later become convinced is a curse dooming the expedition.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800117">Offer the devotees some goods in order to pass</Text>
  <Text ID="800118">Avoid the temple and find another route to the waterfall</Text>
  <Text ID="800148">&lt;b&gt;The men succeed&lt;/b&gt; in finding an alternative route to the waterfall that is also satisfyingly swift. All are happy that they have managed to refill the water so efficiently, and without having to disturb the ritual at the monkey temple.</Text>
  <Text ID="800149">&lt;b&gt;Your crew tries to find a different way,&lt;/b&gt; but it would seem the only option is to reach the high precipice from which the water cascades. The jungle is very dense, and there isn't a clear route up.</Text>
  <Text ID="800150">Search for a route to the waterfall source</Text>
  <Text ID="800152">&lt;b&gt;After some scrabbling amid bristly vegetation,&lt;/b&gt; the tired crew finally get up to the water source and fill the barrels. The journey back down with the heavy burden is equally exhausting, and scarcely feels worth it.</Text>
  <Text ID="800153">&lt;b&gt;The men lose their way terribly,&lt;/b&gt; becoming separated as they try to prove themselves in the ascent. A dreadful thud sends a squawk of birds from the trees - it is one of the crew, impaled upon a monkey-pommeled javelin. The rest flee for the ship, but few will make it that far.</Text>
  <Text ID="800151">Give up and return to the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800154">&lt;b&gt;'What a waste of all our time'&lt;/b&gt; bellows a vexed sailor, and he is not the only one. The word failure is becoming synonymous with this expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="800119">Avoid the island altogether and return to the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800155">&lt;b&gt;The crew troop sourly back to the ship,&lt;/b&gt; disgruntled at being so near, yet so far from this much-needed water source.</Text>
  <Text ID="801001">The Mysterious Artefacts</Text>
  <Text ID="801002">&lt;b&gt;The discovery of several strange artifacts aboard spooks the crew.&lt;/b&gt; Tied to the rigging, bunks, boards, and even atop the captain's desk. A warning, a threat? And who put them there? Since the nearby island is uninhabited, it is sensible only to think the perpetrator must be aboard. The crew must know or have seen something last night! </Text>
  <Text ID="801003">Ask the anthropologist</Text>
  <Text ID="801006">&lt;b&gt;"For good luck,"&lt;/b&gt; remarks the anthropologist, inspecting the spherical red dolls, "for the setting of goals, and perseverance in achieving them. Some people or spirit of this place believe they can help us home." At this, your crew are beguiled.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801004">Ask the crew who did this</Text>
  <Text ID="801007">&lt;b&gt;Your crew are beginning to bond.&lt;/b&gt; Someone comes forward, not having expected to cause such a bother. "They're for me old mum," he sighs, "birds - that one's a little robin. Made 'em together when she was ill. Now she's gone...I..." The others are quick to put an arm round his shoulder; they're all in this together.</Text>
  <Text ID="801008">&lt;b&gt;No one has anything to offer but the priest.&lt;/b&gt; It is his belief that some unholy chapter has opened. The next morning, more of the eerie things have appeared. "Cleanse the idols in holy fire!" he shrieks. "Nonsense," says a soldier. "Set guards within, and we shall have this rat."   </Text>
  <Text ID="801011">Side with the priest and prepare a holy fire</Text>
  <Text ID="801013">&lt;b&gt;The priest gloats over his success.&lt;/b&gt; With a maniacal grin, he sets the mound of idols alight. The fire consumes rapidly, shifting vermillion to viridian. Some say they hear the wood scream as it goes. "Expurgation is God's work, and I am chosen."</Text>
  <Text ID="801014">&lt;b&gt;The fire is chaotic&lt;/b&gt;, and the buckets of water seem not to extinguish, but provoke. The flame leaps to the priest's cassock like spring-heeled jack, and as it sweeps up his back, he is heard to utter his last words,"forgive me father, for I have sinned."  </Text>
  <Text ID="801012">Keep guard and capture the perpetrator</Text>
  <Text ID="801015">&lt;b&gt;The teenagers are remorseful.&lt;/b&gt; "It was a jape, a piece o' trickery sirs, we regret t'were not received so." The crew are forgiving - the youths merely wished to contain their homesickness - and call for just fifty strokes of the birch per bottom.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801016">&lt;b&gt;That night, dire musket-shot is heard.&lt;/b&gt; A dead boy on deck, local. A second is seen diving to blue. Next morning a rhythm comes from an armada of river boats, armed with guns. There island is inhabited, and they know what you have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="801018">Engage in battle.</Text>
  <Text ID="801020">&lt;b&gt;One warning salvo is enough.&lt;/b&gt; The river boats cluster and slow. Though they lower their weapons and allow you to leave, the anger that your crime  goes unpunished couldn't be more marked in their faces. </Text>
  <Text ID="801021">&lt;b&gt;Your ship is a sitting duck.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew cannot man stations fast enough to fire or maneuver. Enemy boats surround your ship, before scaling its sides. The blood shed on both sides will stain this ship and expedition forever.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801019">Leave immediately</Text>
  <Text ID="801022">&lt;b&gt;Once your ship is underway she is free.&lt;/b&gt; Nevertheless your adversaries are excellent shots, and do damage to the sails and aft. The crew will have to make repairs in the days that follow.</Text>
  <Text ID="801023">&lt;b&gt;A traumatic escape.&lt;/b&gt; In the hurry to leave, your ship is spun broadside and exposed to gunfire. There are injuries, but none so deep as the sight of the dead boy's accomplice below. He weeps, and clutches one of the idols - a good luck charm.</Text>
  <Text ID="801017">&lt;b&gt;The sun is solemn that morning.&lt;/b&gt; The bodies of the dead guards are borne to the hold for burial, but not here, upon this cursed rock. Who killed them none know but the sinister effigies. The expedition fumbles on.</Text>
  <Text ID="801009">&lt;b&gt;A destructive episode.&lt;/b&gt; No one has information, or perhaps they withhold it. Consensus tends towards the latter. Someone wants this expedition to fail, and these effigies are a threat. Paranoia festers. At the next port, a large part of the crew opts to quit.     </Text>
  <Text ID="801005">Throw them overboard and move on.</Text>
  <Text ID="801010">&lt;b&gt;Chilling.&lt;/b&gt; As instructed, the crew collect the dolls and throw them overboard. But relief lasts only until the following morning, when the dolls are found returned, placed exactly as they had been. </Text>
  <Text ID="802040">The Mutiny</Text>
  <Text ID="802041">&lt;b&gt;Clear skies, calm seas, and mutiny!&lt;/b&gt; The tension has been building. The everyday strains of an expedition, the rationing of supplies, a lack of recongition from those above them, it has all become too much for the lower-ranks.  They are refusing to take further orders, and have united behind a charismatic spokesperson. It won't take much to push them to full-blooded revolt!</Text>
  <Text ID="802042">Arrange a meeting with the leader of the mutiny</Text>
  <Text ID="802046">&lt;b&gt;They soon reach an understanding.&lt;/b&gt; After all, the demands made by the mutineers are perfectly understandable. The officers address each of their criticisms of the running of the ship, agreeing where possible to make adjustments, and where they find it is not possible, taking the time to explain exactly why things are just fine the way they are. Everyone seems most satisfied with so fair and democratic a resolution.</Text>
  <Text ID="802047">&lt;b&gt;The threat of mutiny is gone, for now.&lt;/b&gt; The negotiations begin well, but ultimately remain unresolved, with the first mate too stubborn to make compromises for his inferiors, and the mutineers seemingly unable to see the bigger picture. After a long and tiresome debate, the mutineers agree to disagree, and grudgingly begin taking orders again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802048">&lt;b&gt;Their leader insists you meet on his turf.&lt;/b&gt; "The officers join us among our squalid bunks, or there'll be no meeting," he says with more than a hint of threat.</Text>
  <Text ID="802049">Agree to meet in the sailors' quarters</Text>
  <Text ID="802051">&lt;b&gt;The leader of the mutineers listens to reason.&lt;/b&gt; That an officer is willing to meet on the lower decks already shows progress has been made, and the humility he then proceeds to show, while listening to the many gripes and grumbles of the crewmen, is enough to defuse the situation, even if nothing has really changed at all...</Text>
  <Text ID="802052">&lt;b&gt;The meeting goes nowhere.&lt;/b&gt; It is clear the problem lies with their leader. He is a force of nature, too incendiary for any of your officers to handle. With each new compromise offered by the your representative he makes further, more unreasonable demands. Something must be done, fast.</Text>
  <Text ID="802054">Quietly poison him</Text>
  <Text ID="802057">&lt;b&gt;The doctor agrees to be an accomplice,&lt;/b&gt; and his complicity proves vital. Dispensing with his moral objections, your medic produces a poison that causes rapid respiratory failure. A man known to be loyal to the captain secretly administers it, and within a few days the chief firebrand of the mutineers is dead. "Cancer of the lung," says the doctor, "most probably caused by stress." No-one suspects a thing, but the officers must keep a terrible secret.</Text>
  <Text ID="802058">&lt;b&gt;It is obvous you tried to poison him.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor refuses to help, saying, "it's despicable, and besides, I know nothing of poisons," so the ship's cook has a go. The wine is discoloured and reeks of death, still the poor fellow is too drunk to notice. It is the doctor who issues an emetic and saves him from death.  "Bastards tried to kill him!" scream the mutineers, as &lt;b&gt;they converge upon the captain's cabin.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802059">In a final attempt to keep order, offer a bribe</Text>
  <Text ID="802061">This will be costly.</Text>
  <Text ID="802062">Okay</Text>
  <Text ID="802064">&lt;b&gt;They take the bribe, but their loyalty cannot be bought.&lt;/b&gt; Trust between commanding officers and crew is shattered. Since there appears no single culprit, it is agreed that all senior officers be put on probation so that any member of the crew may hold them to account for their actions henceforth. Needless to say, the general mood among the officers is low.</Text>
  <Text ID="802063">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802065">&lt;b&gt;Blood is the only payment they will take.&lt;/b&gt; Weakened by the poisoned wine, the leader of the rebels appears on a crutch. His followers part in taciturn awe, as he hobbles forward. "Name your scapegoat," he says. One of the junior officers draws the short straw. "Cut out his eyes!" And with two gruesome oyster scoops, the hierarchy aboard your ship is turned upside down. The Captain has no choice now but to grant several of the rebels positions of authority aboard ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802060">Fight them: officers vs. sailors</Text>
  <Text ID="802066">&lt;b&gt;It's a bloody end, but your officers can fight.&lt;/b&gt; Their academy training stands them in good stead as the dissident rabble charges. The sailors, equipped with hooks, nailboards and anything else they can find, are no match for your sabre-slashing redcoats. Although the mutiny is over, and its leader, too ill to fight, is safely in the brig, it's unlikely all those radical ideas have simply died with those who had held them.</Text>
  <Text ID="802067">&lt;b&gt;The officers show themselves unworthy of power.&lt;/b&gt; Without loyalty, fight, or even discipline, the redcoat defenders are broken by the rabid horde. The leader of the mutineers, still groggy, makes an example of one of the officers, forcing him to drink the same deadly wine he was given. The Captain has no choice but to grant the rebels positions of authority aboard ship. It will be a rocky ride from here.</Text>
  <Text ID="802055">Have him arrested</Text>
  <Text ID="802068">&lt;b&gt;The leader comes quietly,&lt;/b&gt; perhaps because soldiers loyal to the expedition have knocked and asked politely— more dignified that way. He is on his own now. Guards are stationed all along the route to the brig, separating him from his followers. Without their leader to organise and motivate them, the threat of mutiny becomes little more than a grumble.</Text>
  <Text ID="802069">&lt;b&gt;The rebels are ready to die for their leader.&lt;/b&gt; It could have been a quick and clean arrest, but the mutineers who crowd outside their leader's quarters don't seem afraid. In fact, when the inevitable fracas whirls into action, they are vicious. The officers thrust their swords nervously into the pack, knowing that whatbthey are doing is wrong. With the loss of life, the loss of trust, things will never be the same again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802056">Ignore him</Text>
  <Text ID="802070">&lt;b&gt;The mutineers leave the expedition.&lt;/b&gt; The Captain and officers, having failed to provide a solution, cannot hold them to their contracts. Equally, by refusing to negotiate, the leader of the mutineers is now committed to take some formal action. An uncomfortable week of silence passes, before you make port, and a large portion of the crew leaves, taking food and other supplies.</Text>
  <Text ID="802053">&lt;b&gt;Your representative is utterly tactless.&lt;/b&gt; It is late, he has had too much gin, and he barges into the sailor's quarters barking insults and commands. The crew toss aside their paperbacks and swing down from their hammocks, laying into him with their fists. Perhaps they don't mean to kill him, but they do. To settle the matter, the Captain agrees to keep their crime a secret, so long as there's no more talk of mutiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="802050">That's enough disobedience, arrest the chaplain</Text>
  <Text ID="802071">&lt;b&gt;The leader comes quietly,&lt;/b&gt; perhaps because soldiers loyal to the expedition have knocked and asked politely— more dignified that way. He is on his own now.

  <Text ID="802043">Give the ringleader a raise</Text>
  <Text ID="802073">The ringleader looks on greedily</Text>
  <Text ID="802074">Okay</Text>
  <Text ID="802076">&lt;b&gt;A pragmatic solution.&lt;/b&gt; The amount offered to the man to buy his obedience is enough for him to ignore the incongruity of a monetary settlement— a bribe, as it's more often known. What's more he is willing to spread the lie that change is afoot. It's not long before the storm of mutiny has passed overhead.</Text>
  <Text ID="802075">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802077">&lt;b&gt;He refuses, insisting you negotiate on his turf.&lt;/b&gt; "Give us what we ask, or this mob'll turn, I guarantee it," he threatens.</Text>
  <Text ID="802044">Make an example of the ringleader</Text>
  <Text ID="802078">&lt;b&gt;The budding mutiny is crushed.&lt;/b&gt; The first lieutenant and two loyalists are all it takes to seize the ringleaders and present him before the Captain for  judgement. The man is condemned to a marooning on the next island they encounter. The swift arrest and punishment impresses the sailors and renews their respect for their superiors.</Text>
  <Text ID="802079">&lt;b&gt;The loyalists find it difficult to act against their friends.&lt;/b&gt; "Go on then, arrest them!" blares an officer, when they show a moment's hesitation. The ringleader is eventually captured, made a scapegoat and marooned at the next port, but weakness has been shown. A few little cracks have started to appear...</Text>
  <Text ID="802080">&lt;b&gt;The rebels are ready to die for their leader.&lt;/b&gt; It could have been a quick and clean arrest, but the mutineers who crowd outside their leader's quarters don't seem afraid.

  <Text ID="802203">The Amazons</Text>
  <Text ID="802204">&lt;b&gt;The splendid warriors are all women.&lt;/b&gt; Exploring this deserted settlement, which appears to have been the scene of a revolt, seemed a good opportunity for some looting, but your crew aren't the only ones to have had the idea. As they pass the barricades of barrels, tables and chairs, they happen upon a group of warriors, not a man among them. Indeed, the long-trousered women assume a defensive formation so fluently, it's possible they are more than human.</Text>
  <Text ID="802205">Let a woman do the talking</Text>
  <Text ID="802208">&lt;b&gt;She fascinates the warriors,&lt;/b&gt; almost as much as they fascinate her. "Many stray into our territories, rarely does a woman lead them," says the tallest of the goddesses. Neither she nor the others make further mention of these territories, how far they span, or if their people dwell in towns and cities. Your crew are invited to share in what they have found however. As the women lope into the trees, eyes ever watchful, you wonder how they will repurpose all they have harvested from these ruins. For it is your belief they may have stumbled into this chaos, from a distant, more noble age.</Text>
  <Text ID="802206">Present your peaceful intentions</Text>
  <Text ID="802209">&lt;b&gt;They too share a love of exploration and discovery!&lt;/b&gt; Though they know nothing of your language, your envoy takes great pleasure in unravelling his sea chart. Curiosity soon loosens them from formation, as they crowd around him sitting on their shields to see it. He describes the ship in gestures, and when he gets to the sails, for some reason they fall about with laughter. One of them snatches the map, and makes a suggestion as to where you might think of going next. It could be a shortcut!</Text>
  <Text ID="802210">&lt;b&gt;The behaviour of your diplomat is disgusting.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of trying to communicate your good intentions, the belching toad circles them, looking them up and down as if to appraise their value. When he places a greasy hand on one of the warriors cheeks, another of the women breaks from the pack and plants her lance in his thigh.</Text>
  <Text ID="802211">Respond to their violence in kind</Text>
  <Text ID="802213">&lt;b&gt;Firing a few shots skyward is enough.&lt;/b&gt; The warriors have only shields and jagged lances, coming as they do, from some nobler age. Yet the way they fearfully scurry away suggests they are no strangers to firearms. It feels like an opportunity missed to know them better. All that is left is to tend the sorry diplomat, whose leg has a very severe bleed. </Text>
  <Text ID="802214">&lt;b&gt;They are too fast.&lt;/b&gt; The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll and thrust their lances. All your men are killed. The warriors spare your women however, giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text>
  <Text ID="802212">Placate them with gifts</Text>
  <Text ID="802215">The warriors seem interested but watchful</Text>
  <Text ID="802216">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="802218">&lt;b&gt;Your exotic supplies intrigue the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Their curiosity overtakes their anger and seeing how fascinated they are by the crew's maps, the sailors guess that the women might share their taste for exploration. Sadly, it appears too late to earn the warriors' trust and they depart looking cautiously over their shoulders. You must tend the sorry diplomat, for the bleed on his leg is severe.</Text>
  <Text ID="802217">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802219">&lt;b&gt;The warriors take great offence.&lt;/b&gt; One of them spits on the jacket of an officer, who moves to draw his weapon, but they are too fast. The lithe women dive and roll and thrust their lances. All the men of your small scouting party are killed. The women are spared however, the warriors giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.   </Text>
  <Text ID="802207">Bow before the goddesses</Text>
  <Text ID="802220">&lt;b&gt;Your crew's deference pleases the warriors.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the sailors' genuflection, the women giggle and lower their guard, lifting your explorers' chins with the tips of their lances. They may not speak your language, but their body language is unequivocal— they are fellow adventurers, and wish to celebrate your meeting. A huge bonfire is made of the wooden barricades, and all enjoy their boozy punch and haunches of venison—which they insist on eating raw— and the wild party lasts long into the night. </Text>
  <Text ID="802221">&lt;b&gt;Not all in your party show respect.&lt;/b&gt; Some are snickering about something, and the warrior women presume it concerns them. They spit at the men, who reach hot-bloodedly for their weapons.</Text>
  <Text ID="802222">Challenge them to fight</Text>
  <Text ID="802224">&lt;b&gt;This pleases them,&lt;/b&gt; since of all things they are most fond of a good fight. Your men are honourable and choose to fight hand-to-hand. It is a noble and even contest, punctuated by the metallic rasp of sword and spear, ending in stalemate. There have been injuries on both sides, and the two sides part with greater respect for their foes. Still, those injuries will need looking after...</Text>
  <Text ID="802225">&lt;b&gt;They are too fast.&lt;/b&gt; The distance between your small scouting party and the warriors is made up in moments, as the lithe women dive and roll and thrust their lances. All your men are killed. The warriors spare your women however, giving them only wearied looks as they stalk away. The survivors return to the expedition ship, and report the massacre to the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="802223">Accept humiliation and leave</Text>
  <Text ID="802226">&lt;b&gt;The sailors, especially the men, feel humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; "Those warrior women were most strident," says one, "I had absolutely no idea how I should respond to such provocation, for I believe it was always their intention to make us draw our swords upon them, which of course would have been wholly inappropriate!" The women, on the other hand, can't help but dream of escaping this suffocating ship, to take up a lance and shield of their own.</Text>
  <Text ID="802672">The Fugitive</Text>
  <Text ID="802673">&lt;b&gt;Local authorities come aboard looking for the fugitive you've taken in.&lt;/b&gt; A man in rags offered you his services at port, saying he'd do any odd job for food and the chance to join your crew. The Captain agreed to take him on. He soon grew on your sailors, working hard and filling in wherever needed. But above all he has proved a man of principle, a champion of the vulnerable, and as such, the crew have learned to respect his silence on the matter of his past.</Text>
  <Text ID="802675">Pretend you haven't seen him.</Text>
  <Text ID="802679">&lt;b&gt;Your crew stick stoically to the same story.&lt;/b&gt; "This man?" the officials say, holding up a picture of their new friend, "have you seen him?" "Oh no, no," your sailors reply. Still, the officials conduct a cursory search, but the man of many talents has no difficulty hiding from them. When they have gone, there is a hearty cheer. "Glad to have you with us!" bellows the Captain. You have a new recruit!</Text>
  <Text ID="802680">&lt;b&gt;Your attempt at deception fails.&lt;/b&gt; The officer in charge lies that your ship has never docked the port in question, yet the officials present a logbook stating conclusively that it did. This only serves to further rouse their suspicion he is somewhere aboard.</Text>
  <Text ID="802681">Quickly, hide him!</Text>
  <Text ID="802683">&lt;b&gt;Hidden in plain sight!&lt;/b&gt; Sensing how thorough the inspection is going to be, there is only one possible bolthole for your runaway. "Get in the lifeboat, keep your head down," the crewman whispers, while his pursuers are being detained on some pretence in the captain's cabin. The lifeboat is then winched above the eyeline, where sure enough, they never think to look. Not wanting to cause further trouble, he insists on leaving at the next port.</Text>
  <Text ID="802684">&lt;b&gt;"There he is! Seize him!"&lt;/b&gt; The fugitive is still trying to make himself comfortable among a pyramid of barrels, when his pursuers appear. They tackle him and clap him in chains.</Text>
  <Text ID="802685">Don't let them take him</Text>
  <Text ID="802687">&lt;b&gt;They don't give in easily.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors wait until the officials pass them by, before knocking them to the floor, and confiscating their weapons. A shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and armed men in smart navy uniforms pour up the boarding plank onto your deck. There follows a heavy skirmish, but your sailors gain the upper hand. The authorities surrender and retreat. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on leaving at the next port.</Text>
  <Text ID="802688">&lt;b&gt;The fugitive dies,&lt;/b&gt; along with his pursuers. When your men try to lay hands on the port officials, they put a pistol to the fugitive's head. "Try to stop us and he gets it," they say. When your men try to be clever, they blow the fugitive's head off, then blow the head off one of your men, before they themselves can be subdued. The dead prisoner was very popular aboard ship, and your crew wonder if things could possibly have turned out worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="802686">Let them take him</Text>
  <Text ID="802689">&lt;b&gt;Your crew offers no resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel. He tries to express his thanks to your crews for their efforts, but the official growls "no more of your activism", and slaps him sharply across the chops. The prisoner was very popular aboard ship, and your crew believe more should have been done to defend him.</Text>
  <Text ID="802682">Threaten to destroy their ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802690">&lt;b&gt;Your threat is impressive indeed.&lt;/b&gt; Rows of dark mouths poke from their hatches, ready to fire at point blank range! "You must be mad!" says one official, as they skip back across the gangplank to their own ship, suddenly most anxious to leave! Your fugitive is thankful, but does not wish to endanger your expedition further, and waves a warm goodbye at the next port.</Text>
  <Text ID="802691">&lt;b&gt;Your men hesitate at the order,&lt;/b&gt; because they can see the neighbouring ship is not one to be trifled with. Eyeing your sailors as they not-so-secretly prepare for a sea battle, one of the officials sounds his shrill whistle, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers rush from below deck. They fully intend to board you.</Text>
  <Text ID="802692">Fight them!</Text>
  <Text ID="802694">&lt;b&gt;They don't give in easily.&lt;/b&gt; A second shrill whistle sounds from the other ship, and the navy-uniformed brigade pour up the boarding plank onto your deck. But your men are ready for them. There follows a heavy skirmish. Some are injured, but your forces prevail. The authorities surrender and depart. Though grateful, your fugitive wishes to avoid causing further injury by his presence, and insists on alighting at the next port.</Text>
  <Text ID="802695">&lt;b&gt;There's no time.&lt;/b&gt; Your men, still concerned with preparing for a sea battle, are thrown into disarray. "To deck men! To deck!" is the cry, and they dive for their guns and rush to deck, only to be cut down, one-by-one by the men in blue. "Fools!" smirks the official, as the fugitive is trussed in chains, "to think so many died for this worthless streak of spittle... Take him away!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802693">Let them board ship and take the man</Text>
  <Text ID="802676">They'll have to fight you for him</Text>
  <Text ID="802696">&lt;b&gt;You have a new recruit!&lt;/b&gt; "You are welcome to him!" says the more senior of the two officials brightly, "we had no idea he was so important to you." His colleague glances at him nervously, before wrinkling up a fake smile of his own. It is obvious they only discontinue their pursuit because your vessel is far more powerful than theirs. With your ship free to continue, the former fugitive raises a glass, "thank you all" he says, "here's to a triumphant expedition, and beyond!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802697">&lt;b&gt;The officials seem undaunted.&lt;/b&gt; "Oh, I think we should have little to fear from so ill-equipped a ship as yours, but from your hostility, it's clear you are hiding the man we seek." They signal back to their own vessel to ready arms. &lt;b&gt;"Now...think carefully, do you really refuse to give him up?"&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802698">Demonstrate your firepower!</Text>
  <Text ID="802700">&lt;b&gt;It's a point blank exchange,&lt;/b&gt; in which your ship manages to have first shot, disabling half the men opposite. As such, the return fire is not so crippling as it might have been— although significant repairs will be needed. As the two ships drift apart, the officials are left in helpless, comic isolation on your ship's deck. Someone gives them a good old shove overboard, forcing the other ship to go to their rescue. Your crew make their escape. "I will burden you no further," says the fugitive wearily, "please allow me to alight at the next opportunity."</Text>
  <Text ID="802701">&lt;b&gt;It only serves to demonstrate your crew's incompetence,&lt;/b&gt; because they are still not ready! The vessel belonging to the local authority fires first, and being at such close range the effect is devastating. Half of your gunners lie maimed, and your ship shredded through. The white flag is waved. The fugitive leaves with the officials of his own free will, after all, he has better chances of survival almost anywhere else!</Text>
  <Text ID="802699">Surrender the fugitive to them</Text>
  <Text ID="802702">&lt;b&gt;Your crew offers no resistance.&lt;/b&gt; They part before the two officials as they frogmarch the fugitive over the gangplank to their vessel.

  <Text ID="802707">&lt;b&gt;You can't afford him.&lt;/b&gt; Seeing that your men are still reluctant to let the fugitive go, the order is given to lower footbridges, and a troop of navy-uniformed soldiers file into line, ready to board your ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802678">Hand over the fugitive</Text>
  <Text ID="802708">&lt;b&gt;The fugitive does not resist.&lt;/b&gt; With a look of stoic resignation, the man offers the officials his hands to be shackled. He offers turns back one last time before he goes, "thank you for everything," he says— dignified until the very last. The crew shall miss his company greatly.</Text>
  <Text ID="800279">The Predator</Text>
  <Text ID="800280">&lt;b&gt;"A fearsome predator stalks us!"&lt;/b&gt; the cabin-boy whispers. Perhaps he is right, for this resupply has not been as uneventful as hoped. Only the first evening moored in this bay, and a man goes missing - tracks up the beach into jungle. Many wonder how work can be expected to continue...  </Text>
  <Text ID="800281">Bait the creature</Text>
  <Text ID="800286">&lt;b&gt;With the perfect lure&lt;/b&gt; placed enticingly in the crook of a tree, there is an inevitability about a capture. Sure enough, yellow eyes pierce the darkness, and a mighty beast pads softly over to the bait. A net is hurriedly cast about it and secured, thus leaving the expedition free to resupply unthreatened.</Text>
  <Text ID="800282">Send hunters to track it</Text>
  <Text ID="800287">&lt;b&gt;Your huntmasters are expert,&lt;/b&gt; and trace with great care, the soft hollows imprinted by feline paw. Led to a clearing, they correctly judge this to be a lair, where they stand ready with a net. When the cat returns, heaving hot breath, the hunters pounce. With net secure, the expedition is free to resupply unthreatened.</Text>
  <Text ID="800288">&lt;b&gt;At least one hunter did the right thing,&lt;/b&gt; and kept his eyes open while they traced the beast's pawprints. Another was not so wise, and was heard to let out a scream. His comrades were drawn to the spot, and struck the majestic beast down. But not before the damage was done.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800289">&lt;b&gt;Three days pass, and still no word.&lt;/b&gt; There is a common feeling something must be done to save those men.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800290">Send a rescue party</Text>
  <Text ID="800293">&lt;b&gt;It is only something of a relief&lt;/b&gt; when the rescue party return. It's bad news... the hunters are dead. The rescue party described the bright and long-maned beast, and how in a tussle, they slayed it. With the bodies of the hunters buried, the expedition is able to resupply in an atmosphere of respectful silence.</Text>
  <Text ID="800294">&lt;b&gt;"Horror! It's picking us off one by one!"&lt;/b&gt; bawls a fearful sailor, for now the rescue party too, have failed to return. There is nothing for the disconsolate remainder of the crew to do, but leave this sorry place behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="800291">Wait a bit longer</Text>
  <Text ID="800295">&lt;b&gt;Doubtful prayer brings no news&lt;/b&gt; of the lost hunters. The men have nowhere to look for guidance, and there is a burdensome feeling that a decision must be made.</Text>
  <Text ID="800296">&lt;b&gt;Conviction in the lord is of little use here,&lt;/b&gt; it seems. Two days later a hunter, whose leg is mangled, limps back into view. After the necessary amputation, he is heard to groan that the others perished. All must leave this savage place.</Text>
  <Text ID="800292">Leave the island without them</Text>
  <Text ID="800297">&lt;b&gt;"We leave them for dead,&lt;/b&gt; when they could be right there now waiting for us!" cries a furious old tar. Like so many others, he is disgusted that good men should give their lives for nothing but impatience!</Text>
  <Text ID="800283">Speak with locals</Text>
  <Text ID="800298">&lt;b&gt;"Absurd magic, but it works!"&lt;/b&gt; say officers sent to the inland village for help. Having described the beast, they were referred to a witch. She encouraged them to ingest live scorpions, one of each colour; yellow, red and black. This they did reluctantly, but found when they confronted the animal, it took flight. All promptly follow the witch's advice, and sure enough, remain undisturbed for the remainder of the resupply.    </Text>
  <Text ID="800299">&lt;b&gt;"Our plight means nothing to the locals,"&lt;/b&gt; bemoan the officers sent as diplomats. "Telling them beasts stalk the jungle, is as like alerting a hatter to the presence of hats on his hatstands."</Text>
  <Text ID="800300">&lt;b&gt;"Their deity is desecrated!"&lt;/b&gt; urges the officer sent as diplomat. All around the bay, daubed faces appear, bows raised to the expedition camp. </Text>
  <Text ID="800301">Teach them a lesson</Text>
  <Text ID="800303">&lt;b&gt;"A hollow victory",&lt;/b&gt; say the men. For the locals lie dead, but the jungle beast stalks on.</Text>
  <Text ID="800304">&lt;b&gt;Odds against them, the men fight as best they can.&lt;/b&gt; Fought back onto the sand, they deflect the rain of arrows with whatever they can lay hands on. A relay is able to return precious equipment to the ship and set sail, but not without a number of casualties, of whom some do not make it.</Text>
  <Text ID="800305">&lt;b&gt;The onslaught is deadly.&lt;/b&gt; Few among your crew have the requisite experience to defend themselves, and so the sand reddens with their blood. Of those who make it as far as the expedition ship, a number succumb to the poison-tip arrows. It is a massacre.</Text>
  <Text ID="800302">Run for the ship!</Text>
  <Text ID="800306">&lt;b&gt;"Run!" comes the panicked cry.&lt;/b&gt; The men drop their work, and tramp desperately through the shallows to the ship. A volley of arrows pierces three, squirting crimson into the clear blue. "Dead aside, we have lost a great deal more in provisions than we have gained," laments the quartermaster, as your ship departs that wretched bay.</Text>
  <Text ID="800284">Lay a trap</Text>
  <Text ID="800307">&lt;b&gt;The ingenious powers&lt;/b&gt; of the craftsmen among your crew have fashioned a pitfall for the beast. There is not long to wait before there is a tinkle on the handbell, and all can gather above the trap to see the monster growling at its bottom. The resupply may now happily proceed, knowing that danger is averted.</Text>
  <Text ID="800308">&lt;b&gt;The beast is too intelligent&lt;/b&gt; to fall for makeshift traps. It is clearly evading the pitfall prepared by those supposed to be the expedition's deftest craftsmen. "Little more we can do," they shrug.</Text>
  <Text ID="800285">Leave the island</Text>
  <Text ID="800309">&lt;b&gt;"It's a considerable setback,"&lt;/b&gt; say senior officers. Fresh water, wood for burning, plants for medicine - it does no good to list what myriad opportunities are missed in bypassing the bay. And all for the sake of fears over one measly wild animal.</Text>
  <Text ID="800605">A Grizzly Encounter</Text>
  <Text ID="800606">&lt;b&gt;Bear attack!&lt;/b&gt; The party ponder this very real possibility as threatening grunts stop them dead among the firs. Fifty yards ahead, a huge specimen lurches up on two legs like a totem, standing between them and escape. More grunting echoes nearby. The party stay silent, awaiting guidance.</Text>
  <Text ID="800607">Scare the bears away</Text>
  <Text ID="800611">&lt;b&gt;Boooooom!&lt;/b&gt; The valley shudders with the sweet stench of exploded dynamite. The bears hurry away, leaving the crew thoroughly entertained at the superiority of mankind and the power of invention.</Text>
  <Text ID="800608">Use hunting knowledge to get the better of the bears</Text>
  <Text ID="800612">&lt;b&gt;Trust in the expert hunters never feels misplaced&lt;/b&gt;, even when they recommend the party break into passionate song. For singing the shanty "Cheerly-ay-oh" brings the crew together, whilst also dispersing the wary bears deep into the forest.</Text>
  <Text ID="800613">&lt;b&gt;The hunters lack guile.&lt;/b&gt; They have enough to lead the crew on a route silent as a church, but not enough to stop a bear sniffing them out. It's easy to believe from its vacant eyes, that it sees you as a potentially delicious kind of threat.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800615">Attack the bear</Text>
  <Text ID="800617">&lt;b&gt;The bear's face proves a good target.&lt;/b&gt; Ducking the terrifying whooshes of its paws, someone manages to prime their pistol and shoot it through the eye. The bear drops dead. No-one feels particularly good about killing it, but the way ahead is now clear.</Text>
  <Text ID="800618">&lt;b&gt;Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.&lt;/b&gt; The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.</Text>
  <Text ID="800619">&lt;b&gt;It's easy to underestimate mummy bears.&lt;/b&gt; As the soldiers fluff the loading of their weapons, the bear nonchalantly grasps one by the wrist, and sinks her jaw into his neck. The others panic and flee with their arms in the air. She pursues a second, striking him dead against a rock. Now she and her cubs can finally be left in peace.</Text>
  <Text ID="800616">Outmanoeuver the bear</Text>
  <Text ID="800620">&lt;b&gt;Sometimes it helps to know your hill contours.&lt;/b&gt; The crew carefully fall away, circumventing the bear's position, and keeping their backs to the mountainside. With the higher ground, the bear appears to lose interest. Hearts pumping, the crew hurry to safety.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800621">&lt;b&gt;Stupidly the crew decide to run, and reach a dead-end.&lt;/b&gt; The bear pursues at a leisurely speed, yet with no less menace, and the crew are forced to seek refuge in a cave, or else try climbing the trees.</Text>
  <Text ID="800623">Hide in the cave and pray</Text>
  <Text ID="800625">&lt;b&gt;Against all anxiety, the Bear doesn't follow.&lt;/b&gt; Still, the men in the cave are too afraid to light a fire, or sleep through the night. Shattered and hungry, they emerge the next morning, only to find their sacrifice was wholly unnecessary. </Text>
  <Text ID="800626">&lt;b&gt;Bears can see terribly well in the dark&lt;/b&gt;, and since your crew have stumbled into its house, where its vulnerable infants sleep, it is not very happy. The crew that do manage to break for daylight have clothes ragged and torn, and cannot speak, for it is clear they were the lucky ones.</Text>
  <Text ID="800624">Climb the trees</Text>
  <Text ID="800627">&lt;b&gt;The crew climb the trees well enough&lt;/b&gt;, but the bear isn't going to make their lives easy. It is a full day and night before it gives up shaking trunks, or climbing halfway up towards the dangling crew. When it finally leaves, the exhausted crew descend, their nerves in shreds.</Text>
  <Text ID="800628">&lt;b&gt;Bears are awfully good at climbing trees&lt;/b&gt;, and as on this occasion, it is not uncommon to see them strike their adversaries from the branches. Its hapless victim plunges from the canopy and lands like a sack of red berries on rocks below. Others injure themselves as the men drop from the trees in a desperate escape.</Text>
  <Text ID="800614">&lt;b&gt;Call themselves hunters!&lt;/b&gt; The tracks thought to lead away from bear territory go instead to a clearing at its heart. The bears at first seem alarmed their picnic is disturbed, until they realise your crew are on the menu. The sound of crunching bone rings in the ears of the few that manage to flee.</Text>
  <Text ID="800609">Attack the bear blocking the way</Text>
  <Text ID="800629">&lt;b&gt;The lone bear's haunch is picked out with expert marksmanship.&lt;/b&gt; It staggers before bounding off into the woods. Your crew are delighted to return to the safety of the ship, whilst also having done the mighty beast no lasting harm.</Text>
  <Text ID="800630">&lt;b&gt;The first volley of shots miss&lt;/b&gt;, and the bear attacks. A second shot finds its mark, and the wounded bear escapes into the trees, but a man lies dead. His brother cries revenge, and is already off into the woods to hunt the grisly killer.</Text>
  <Text ID="800632">Track the wounded bear with him</Text>
  <Text ID="800634">&lt;b&gt;Bittersweet.&lt;/b&gt; Your fine tracking skills allow the crew to catch up with the bear and watch it from hiding. It is a she-bear, and is now nuzzling its young cubs. "That is why she killed him," says the brother, gone all vitriol. "Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place."  </Text>
  <Text ID="800635">&lt;b&gt;The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.&lt;/b&gt; Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.</Text>
  <Text ID="800636">&lt;b&gt;Hunting is impossible with passions running this high.&lt;/b&gt; When another man snaps a twig, the vengeful brother attacks him wildly, and the others fail to intervene. The brother's eyes glaze as he slides to the earth, bayonet in his back. </Text>
  <Text ID="800633">Leave the fool behind</Text>
  <Text ID="800637">&lt;b&gt;The decision is unpopular.&lt;/b&gt; "Stubborn 'til the end," say those in the minority. But the greater part have things to say on the subject of dishonour. "Those brothers loved each other to the end," remarks one old sailor, "and what little love did we show for them..." </Text>
  <Text ID="800631">&lt;b&gt;Out here, bears rule.&lt;/b&gt; The wildly inaccurate gunfire  serves only to rile the bear into a frenzy, and draw attention to your position. Then a second, larger bear thunders from the undergrowth and mauls a man to death. A few of your piffling soldiery manage to escape with all their limbs attached.</Text>
  <Text ID="800610">Use Camouflage</Text>
  <Text ID="800638">&lt;b&gt;The bears have no chance.&lt;/b&gt; Indeed, the camouflage is so good, the crew can barely see one another! Thickly daubed in the colours of the forest, the chameleon crew bypass the bears with ease. A story of ingenuity at which their grandchildren shall marvel!</Text>
  <Text ID="800639">&lt;b&gt;Even the most hardened sailors find the smell unbearable.&lt;/b&gt; Not to mention the indignity of covering oneself in bear excrement for longer than is perfectly necessary. Eventually though the bears depart, leaving the reeking crew free to have a much-needed wash. </Text>
  <Text ID="800640">&lt;b&gt;Dressing as pantomime trees is a bad idea&lt;/b&gt;, and as the bears attack, the flimsy branches the crew intended to cover their faces prove no more effective in self-defence. The ensuing scene might have made for an impressive spectacle on the stage, though only as the most gruesome of tragedies.</Text>
  <Text ID="802299">Release the Kraken</Text>
  <Text ID="802300">&lt;b&gt;Could it be the kraken?!&lt;/b&gt; Or what are those "tentacles wide as a barrel and long as bowsprits" your lookout claims to have spotted protruding from the treacle-black swell? Creature of legend or no, a shadow below the surface is hurtling towards your ship at full speed!</Text>
  <Text ID="802301">Fire a torpedo at the thing</Text>
  <Text ID="802304">&lt;b&gt;The hulking cephalopod is no match for the torpedo!&lt;/b&gt; The self-propelled projectile requires no special effort to dispatch, and yet its underwater prowess is indisputible. It crashes into the kraken with a wallop that sends a profusion of octo-bits frothing to the surface. The crew are delighted to discover the flesh is cooked yet not at all rubbery.</Text>
  <Text ID="802305">Kill the monster</Text>
  <Text ID="802306">&lt;b&gt;THUNK! An excellent shot!&lt;/b&gt; The harpoon lodges into the creature's ample-sized brain. It takes no little effort to haul the reddish mantle and decimette of long pulpous limbs aboard. No-one is going to believe this trophy when they see it, or that something of this size swam at such threatening velocity! Why its eyes alone are half a metre wide!</Text>
  <Text ID="802307">&lt;b&gt;Sloppy shooting from your pod of suckers.&lt;/b&gt; The twisting aberration slinks and jets obliquely, its mantle engorged and thrumming with arcane energy. Its lip-like suckers pucker and latch to the hull, levering its beaked face up above the starboard rail in peek-a-boo. It is vast!</Text>
  <Text ID="802308">Slice its meaty tentacles!</Text>
  <Text ID="802309">&lt;b&gt;The monstrosity detaches violently!&lt;/b&gt; Your men hack fiercely and without relent at a key tentacle until it severs. The loopeyed beast blubbers a pained raspberry, coating the deck with plankton-infused clamminess, before tearing itself back into the sea, a large section of your ship in tow! Some repairs will be needed!</Text>
  <Text ID="802310">&lt;b&gt;There are just too many legs!&lt;/b&gt; Having been interrupted at dinner, your sailors try to improvise a dissection with their knives and forks, but the monstrosity just refuses to be kalamari. Its innumerable tendrils cavort, punching holes and tossing sailors! One fellow is flung so perfectly that his return trajectory lands him directly, and fatally, atop a flagpole. Having satiated itself on flesh and timber, the kraken detaches and bolts away with typical flourish.</Text>
  <Text ID="802311">Blow it away!</Text>
  <Text ID="802312">&lt;b&gt;Right in the mandibles!&lt;/b&gt; The kraken inhales the slew of heavy artillery and is propelled outwards and star-like, before plummeting to the depths with a good part of your ship still in its grip. Repairs will be needed! You cannot think why the creature was so offended by your presence, but at least it now has some memento of your meeting to clutch onto.</Text>
  <Text ID="802313">&lt;b&gt;Your gunmen cannot keep their feet long enough.&lt;/b&gt; The ctenidious cephalopod rocks the ship to and fro, shaking your boys from the big guns, before sealing itself over an open window and sucking up men as if it had its straw in an ice cream sundae. Eventually after enough poking and prodding the monstrosity relinquishes its goily grasp, and flops back to the deep to digest the better part of your crew to a liquid.</Text>
  <Text ID="802315">Outrun the thing</Text>
  <Text ID="802316">&lt;b&gt;A powerful spurt of propulsion!&lt;/b&gt; The unnatural power of your steam ship eclipses the jetting shadow from the far, far depths. The ship's horn sounds a farewell salute to the creature, who those present swear is equipped with two clocktower eyes within which ink-black pupils swim delirious. For now it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.</Text>
  <Text ID="802317">&lt;b&gt;The wind is with you.&lt;/b&gt; Whatever that bird-beaked nest of serpents below is, it relaxes its piston-like pursuit once your crew have succeeded in catching the best of the prevailing breeze. Those present swear it was equipped with two clocktower eyes within which ink-black pupils swam delirious. For now it seems, its wait for a suitable mate must go on.</Text>
  <Text ID="802318">&lt;b&gt;Your crew cannot manage to disentangle themselves,&lt;/b&gt; for the creature is in search of a mate, and filled with frightful lust. Only once it has clambered up the side, and attached its hectocotylus to your ship, does it begin to have misgivings about the romantic potential of this union, and start thinking about dinner instead...</Text>
  <Text ID="802320">Teeth of the Mountain</Text>
  <Text ID="802321">&lt;b&gt;A track leading over these impenetrable mountains should be a blessing,&lt;/b&gt; yet your men are having doubts. Your guide for a start, absolutely refuses to go up that way. In fact, the idea scares him. At the base of the mountain, which juts ferrous and fibrous above the green like a chunk of braised meat, is a stone head carved in the rock. It grins awfully, and between its huge square teeth is what appears to be a severed arm.</Text>
  <Text ID="802322">Follow the track</Text>
  <Text ID="802323">&lt;b&gt;The trail leads through the centre of a hilltop village,&lt;/b&gt; the straw shelters improbably nestled between steep-sided slopes. But it is the appearance of the inhabitants that astonishes; they are, seemingly unlike all other peoples of this great rainforest, tall and pale, blond-haired and blue-eyed. "Why, what can their story be?" someone chuckles, only to find their companions oddly tense.</Text>
  <Text ID="802324">Approach the inhabitants</Text>
  <Text ID="802325">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat establishes a common heritage!&lt;/b&gt; At least, their language certainly suggests as much; there are familiar sounding terms such as "gonne" and "gun" for example, although the words for water, tree and mountain are consistent with local dialects. Their mythology appears to centre around a tall, blue-eyed ancestor, who long ago came from the Old World, and eloped up this mountain with a local woman in order to conceive the eagles who now circle its peak. Your party receive the stories with great interest and are made to feel very welcome.</Text>
  <Text ID="802326">&lt;b&gt;Your envoy's approach is based upon an assumption.&lt;/b&gt; "Hello!" she exclaims suddenly, "what brings you to these godforsaken hills?" But the villagers cannot understand her. They begin to close in on her.</Text>
  <Text ID="802327">Rescue her</Text>
  <Text ID="802328">&lt;b&gt;She is saved, at least.&lt;/b&gt; "Feels like we killed one of our own today," says a soldier, in reference to the villager they shot. "Not really..." another replies, "...but it's terrible he had to die nonetheless." Your expedition leaves the mountain pass quickly, so the pale and mysterious community can begin to mourn this violation.</Text>
  <Text ID="802329">&lt;b&gt;The enemy take the high ground,&lt;/b&gt; guns and projectiles proving rather effective for them. They rush their hostage to the neck of the pass, to a large rocky outcrop. It is the perfect cover from which to assault your party, exposed as they are on the bald crest of a slope. Men are dying, it's hopeless to remain. Later, imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, the survivors cannot help but remember the stone head they saw, and the human limb in its jaws.</Text>
  <Text ID="802331">Leave her</Text>
  <Text ID="802332">&lt;b&gt;It's a dreadful feeling.&lt;/b&gt; Scrambling down the mountain, your expedition hears a sudden and piercing scream. "You never know, she might survive yet," someone remarks, but later, as they are imagining the fate of the poor diplomat, your survivors cannot help but remember the giant stone head they saw at the foot of the mountain, and the human limb in its jaws.</Text>
  <Text ID="802333">Watch from a distance</Text>
  <Text ID="802334">&lt;b&gt;It is an opportune moment&lt;/b&gt; that your expedition chooses to skirt around and rejoin the mountain track further up. Aside from what is most likely to be some distant Old World heritage, there is nothing especially remarkable about the daily business of this tribe, except that they are far too focused on the collection of honeycomb from a very tall tree to notice you.</Text>
  <Text ID="802336">&lt;b&gt;Not too clever.&lt;/b&gt; Fearing exposure up on the slopes, your men opt to tiptoe through the village. Perhaps they smell too delicious, because the pallid, hungry-looking villagers emerge from their dwellings as one, equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...</Text>
  <Text ID="802337">Apologise for trespassing</Text>
  <Text ID="802338">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat finds common ground,&lt;/b&gt; although not what you might expect. It just so happens that these people are about to tuck in to a feast of human remains. Your diplomat reassures the expedition, "it is their practice to eat their loved ones when they die. Rather beautiful when you think about it." Nevertheless, your crew are rather pleased not to have to partake, and continue on their way.</Text>
  <Text ID="802339">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat fails to control her nerves.&lt;/b&gt; She breaks down whimpering, and one of your manly men muscles in front of her. "Now listen here!" he bellows, "get back you fiends! Get back or I'll cut you down!" But pale and uncomprehending, still they come. Your brute wavers, looks as if he has seen a ghost. He turns and runs down the mountain with the others. It will be a hard road on from here.</Text>
  <Text ID="802340">Draw weapons!</Text>
  <Text ID="802341">&lt;b&gt;Where discretion fails, force prevails.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew is unfazed by the singular appearance of the villagers and springs into action. Their villagers expressions remain resolute, even as they flee up the mountain to take refuge with the condors. But there is sadness behind those eyes; this isn't fair. Your men loot the village.</Text>
  <Text ID="802342">&lt;b&gt;Many of your expedition will be eaten,&lt;/b&gt; or so your survivors believe. They should have fought as if their lives depended on it, but the ferocity and ingenuity with which the mountain ghosts took them was a great shock. The question as to the provenance of the local people has only become cloudier, but those who fled the mountain will not forget them any time soon.  </Text>
  <Text ID="802343">&lt;b&gt;Your explorers find themselves surrounded.&lt;/b&gt; Those leading the group have their heads so buried in their maps, they do not realise they have blundered right through a village. The villagers are oddly tall and pale, with blue eyes and blonde hair. They look hungry, and are equipped with all sorts of sharp-looking implements...</Text>
  <Text ID="802344">Avoid the tracks</Text>
  <Text ID="802347">&lt;b&gt;A shortcut may have been ignored, but fair progress is made.&lt;/b&gt; Declining the invitation to enter the territory of whomever made that gruesome stone carving, your crew feel a sense of relief, despite the extra effort the alternative route will demand of them. Along the way, your officers surmise that trangressing into the territory of the local people is seldom necessary, or desirable.</Text>
  <Text ID="802348">&lt;b&gt;Avoiding the tracks means getting lost,&lt;/b&gt; the steep contour of the valley confusing what limited grasp of the geography your explorers have. They emerge a week of aimless wandering later, devoured not by the cannibals rumoured in these parts, but by the mosquitoes and leeches so at home near the flooded river.</Text>
  <Text ID="802351">Cities of Gold</Text>
  <Text ID="802352">&lt;b&gt;The faded ink...gold leaf...could this map lead to El Doodah?&lt;/b&gt; It fluttered into the hands your sailors, who believe it the most bona fide clue in centuries as to the location of the city of gold. They are already imagining hulking neckchains of the stuff to match their earrings. Why even the captain has suggested hiring a guide! Yet the greedy have come this way before, and it never does seem to end well...</Text>
  <Text ID="802353">Hire a guide</Text>
  <Text ID="802354">"El Doodah, you say? Yes, I know something of it..."</Text>
  <Text ID="802355">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="802356">&lt;b&gt;He has been searching for the Mesoan city his whole life,&lt;/b&gt; and the intensity with which he examines the map suggests he is on the verge of a breakthrough. "Further west than I ever—" he looks to the forest "—but no reason it couldn't lie beyond Lake Guavatita". A few days hike up the river basin and Lake Guavatita shows herself, just like the jagged dagger of water on your map. Beside a high waterfall, &lt;b&gt;your guide shows you a stone marked with Mesoan glyphs.&lt;/b&gt; "This marks the end of the trail," he says.</Text>

  <Text ID="802358">&lt;b&gt;Looks like you're on your own.&lt;/b&gt; The guide scoffs at your valuation of his services, "Everyone from here to Porto Tristeza will hear what a greedy bunch of conquistador pigs you are!"</Text>
  <Text ID="802359">Read the map yourselves</Text>
  <Text ID="802361">&lt;b&gt;The trail ends at a stone covered in glyphs.&lt;/b&gt; Following the confluence of high waters as they weave in and out of one another, you arrive several days later at the lake marked on the faded map. A keen-eyed young whippersnapper notices unmarked stones at regular intervals, which culminate at a waterfall, and a stone whose inscription must have been made long ago.</Text>
  <Text ID="802362">Interpret the Mesoan glyphs</Text>
  <Text ID="802363">&lt;b&gt;You strike gold!&lt;/b&gt; Metaphorically, at least. "The fourth rain god, yes!" your anthropologist reads from the glyphs, and scampers off yelling, "corresponds with our North!" When the archaeologist wades back through the small lagoon, they have a big smile on their face. It is a hoard of greater archaeological value than any of the materials from which it is composed! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it is quite remarkable enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="802364">Survey the area</Text>
  <Text ID="802365">&lt;b&gt;A secret passage!&lt;/b&gt; In a nearby rock face is a gap, scarcely wide enough to slip through, that might easily have been missed but for the thoroughness of the search. One-by-one the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals &lt;b&gt;a rock fall blocking the way ahead,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;crawlways branching in all directions.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
  <Text ID="802366">Clear the rock fall</Text>
  <Text ID="802367">&lt;b&gt;What wonders laid bare!&lt;/b&gt; A sturdy scaffold is built to support the ceiling, before a human chain clears the debris. The antechamber ahead radiates! It is a hoard of greater archaeological value than any of the materials from which it is composed! This may not be the city of El Doodah, but it is quite remarkable enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="802368">&lt;b&gt;The whole roof seems to give way!&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they should have thought to secure the ceiling first, because as they move a large stone, a primeval bellow comes from above. "Run! RUN!" is the cry, as they all rush out. When the noise subsides, the passage is discovered sealed. In any case, there are some who have been injured by the falling debris, and must urgently be taken to a doctor.   </Text>
  <Text ID="802369">Investigate the crawlways</Text>
  <Text ID="802370">&lt;b&gt;Your cavers triumph!&lt;/b&gt; The clammy confinement of the place is hard to negotiate at first, but your crawlers never lose their sense of direction, pushing forward on their tummies until a fresh breeze tingles. "There! A city!" The cavern opens out to an extensive underground ruin, preserved by the clay. El Doodah or no, there are no doubt some remarkable finds to be made!     </Text>
  <Text ID="802371">&lt;b&gt;Few have any experience of caving.&lt;/b&gt; The route they take is clammy and claustrophobic, and seems to be leading nowhere, when there is a sudden and awful screeching of bats! A man loses his footing and falls through a gap— he has broken a leg. His rescue is especially tiresome. It takes several hours in the confined space, which he fills with his moans whenever anyone so much as touches the injured leg. &lt;b&gt;You are forced to abandon your search for El Doodah.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802372">&lt;b&gt;"No glimmer of this golden city! Not even behind the waterfall,"&lt;/b&gt;  the lieutenant teases, "and besides, these 'glyphs'..." He drops to his haunches and feels the grooves in the stone. "Looks like plain water erosion to me." The captain nods. "Alright men, you heard the lieutenant, time to give up this fool's errand." Your expedition leaves disappointed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802373">Divine the meaning of the glyph stone</Text>
  <Text ID="802374">&lt;b&gt;Praise be, a secret passage!&lt;/b&gt; One of the men is unexpectedly knowledgeable on Mesoan theology. "That symbol's in my improving bunk book sir, Cap'n, sir— means god of the underworld." Sure enough, in a nearby rock face is a gap scarcely wide enough to slip through, that might easily have been missed. One-by-one the expedition enters to find themselves in a natural cavern, through which a cool wind whips. A little light reveals &lt;b&gt;a rock fall blocking the way ahead,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;crawlways branching in all directions.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
  <Text ID="802375">&lt;b&gt;The glyph stone provides no inspiration.&lt;/b&gt; "It is a myth! A lie!" Your frustrated lieutenant kicks at it, "did we expect some golden city to descend on a cloud for us?" The captain sees only one way to dispel the frustration. "Alright men, you heard the lieutenant, time to give up this fool's errand." Your expedition leaves disappointed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802377">&lt;b&gt;Your men succumb to their greed.&lt;/b&gt; The map must have been a cruel hoax! The worst thing was that it raised hopes. Some of its landmarks— a high waterfall, a boulder improbably perched— are found really to exist. Beyond that, there is nothing, but gold fever has already set in. Weeks, months go by before some of your people get a grip of themselves again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802378">Refuse to believe in a city of gold</Text>
  <Text ID="802379">&lt;b&gt;Everyone is disappointed.&lt;/b&gt; Aside from those in it for the riches, many believe a gilt-edged opportunity to unearth important discoveries has been passed up. After all, that is the whole purpose of expeditions such as this, is it not?</Text>
  <Text ID="802567">A Fistful of Doubloons</Text>
  <Text ID="802568">&lt;b&gt;The ship's coffers have been emptied!&lt;/b&gt; Your purser knew these new recruits had a wicked air about them. As soon as the ship reached port and the sailors were allowed some rest, the three landsmen merged with the local crowd and disappeared and with them went weeks of pay. The theft was planned in every minute detail - your sailors have been robbed by professionals.</Text>
  <Text ID="802570">Track the thieves down</Text>
  <Text ID="802572">&lt;b&gt;The fleeing footprints are easily found.&lt;/b&gt; The tracks of the thieves' limping leader stand out in the dust. The grazing light of the setting sun highlights the path for your huntsmen and leads them away from the town and closer to its river, where tracks disappear in the water. The hills rise sharply on the other side.</Text>
  <Text ID="802574">Look for a ford to cross on foot</Text>
  <Text ID="802576">&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The crew's expertise shines as they rapidly spot a shallow part in the river and cross it without much inconvenience. They go up the sharp hill of the opposite bank and happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.</Text>
  <Text ID="802578">Attempt to catch wild horses</Text>
  <Text ID="802580">&lt;b&gt;The tamed horses easily catch up with your prey.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters lasso the wild animals and break them before launching them through the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves' horses, whose speed is no match for wild ones. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text>
  <Text ID="802581">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are not made to catch land animals.&lt;/b&gt; The hunt ends in failure, the most your crew saw of a wild horse being weathered tracks in the dry roads. Instead of leading your hunters to a herd, the tracks drive them to a run-down town of wooden buildings -several houses and a single saloon-, its lanterns brightening with the growing darkness. Night is well on its way and tracking the thieves seems almost impossible now.</Text>
  <Text ID="802582">Ask the locals for help</Text>
  <Text ID="802585">&lt;b&gt;The locals agree to help.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat carefully brings the subject of thieves to a man of imposing authority, the sheriff in charge of the small town. The modus operandi is familiar to him: a local gang is famous for their sneaking around foreign businessmen, but he never would have imagined they'd be so bold as to rob a ship. If the robbery was today, he says, the thieves are sure to come and celebrate at the saloon tonight.</Text>
  <Text ID="802587">Wait on the town's balconies, ready for an ambush</Text>
  <Text ID="802589">&lt;b&gt;A clean job.&lt;/b&gt; As soon as the thieves come into sight, your sailors stealthily lay their firearms on the rail guards of balconies and aim and fire in rapid succession. The shots resonate through the quiet town: one shot, one permanent sleeper. When the sound and smell of gunshots settle down, the sheriff salutes your crew's help in getting rid of local pests and ensures the sailors that their reputation will be made known through the West.</Text>
  <Text ID="802590">&lt;b&gt;Rout.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors fire as soon as the gang comes into view, taking little time to aim and even less to observe their targets. The bullets graze past the thieves and upset their horses, who rear and jump before running away with their riders. A night drizzle starts falling and soon drowns their tracks. That's as far as the crew's efforts, notable but inefficient, can go.</Text>
  <Text ID="802588">Wait at the saloon, ready for a fight</Text>
  <Text ID="802591">&lt;b&gt;Honour and wages are retrieved.&lt;/b&gt;When the gang slams the saloon's doors open, the place is devoid of its usual chirpy atmosphere. Moon rays disclose the presence of your crew, sat on every possible chair and table and stair step and already reaching for their guns. The fight is brief. Your sailors submerge the thieves and drag them outside, roped and gagged, and salute the sheriff before heading back to the ship with the satisfaction of a job well done.</Text>
  <Text ID="802592">&lt;b&gt;Your crew is no match for the criminals.&lt;/b&gt; When the gang barges into the saloon, the sailors are still arguing over how to handle the fighting in such a closed space. The fight is short-lived. Your sailors lack the rough training and ability of their opponents and can barely fling insults at them, even less punches. The beaten crew is thrown outside and scampers away from the town - very aware of how lucky they are to still be alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="802586">&lt;b&gt;Your crew is held responsible for the deserters' actions.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of probing around to get an idea of the runaways' reputation, your diplomat immediately asks about the thieves. The men are well-known in the worst way and the locals are shocked to hear your crew hosted them, regardless of the theft - the sailors are forced to leave when surrounded by stern-looking gunslingers. The track ends here. More than money, your sailors have lost morale.</Text>
  <Text ID="802584">Avoid trouble and simply give up</Text>
  <Text ID="802593">&lt;b&gt;So much effort for such a meagre reward.&lt;/b&gt; Feeling the pressure of unseen stares, your crew avoids the shady town and backs away to the harbour city and their ship. Better to decide on your own to withdraw than to be forced to, the sailors tell themselves. Frustration nibbles their thoughts as they set sail.</Text>
  <Text ID="802579">Buy horses from the breeder</Text>
  <Text ID="802594">You can choose either to rent or buy a mount</Text>
  <Text ID="802595">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="802597">&lt;b&gt;The animals catch up with your prey in no time!&lt;/b&gt; In a flurry of dust and whinnying, the mounts assail the barren plains. The blurry hot air parts to reveal the thieves, perched atop horses already exhausted from their mishandling. Your riders surround them and the menace of their number and drawn pistols hushes any resistance. The sailors, satisfied and avenged, retrieve their loot and entrust the scoundrels to the local law.</Text>
  <Text ID="802596">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802598">&lt;b&gt;Your crew will make do on its own.&lt;/b&gt; The price for the withered mares reeks of scam and your sailors refuse to pay a single pound for the animals. Their observations might be influenced by the light weight of their purses.</Text>
  <Text ID="802607">Get on your horses</Text>
  <Text ID="802577">&lt;b&gt;Your crew finds no guarantee of safe crossing.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors quickly get tired of the senseless search: the river's depth cannot be appraised by their untrained eyes, and each segment of the water seems both deep and shallow. The crew is too reluctant to try its luck, and abandons its search, disgruntled.</Text>
  <Text ID="802575">Create a raft to cross the river</Text>
  <Text ID="802599">&lt;b&gt;A safe passage!&lt;/b&gt; The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew boards the opposite bank safely and climbs the hill rising right beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew needs horses.</Text>
  <Text ID="802600">&lt;b&gt;The raft can't even float.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together, binding them with sturdy knots but little knowledge of how to actually assemble the ropes. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing onto it, and the raft swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy water. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.</Text>
  <Text ID="802573">&lt;b&gt;No tracks are found.&lt;/b&gt; The bustling harbour and the late evening insist on hiding the thieves' tracks. Your sailors are not skilled enough to pick up the faint trail inside the town itself, but they might have better luck around its outskirts.</Text>
  <Text ID="802601">Keep searching</Text>
  <Text ID="802603">&lt;b&gt;Finally, tracks to follow!&lt;/b&gt; Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade in the water.</Text>
  <Text ID="802604">&lt;b&gt;Isn't this humiliation enough?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew keeps foraging through the outskirts of town, but they still cannot find any tracks.</Text>
  <Text ID="802602">Stop these futile efforts</Text>
  <Text ID="802605">&lt;b&gt;Your purser protests but the decision is final.&lt;/b&gt; Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.</Text>
  <Text ID="802571">Let them be</Text>
  <Text ID="802606">&lt;b&gt;Your purser protests but the decision is final.&lt;/b&gt; Going after the thieves in a territory they seem to know by heart while the crew itself is in foreign territory? The risk will not be taken. As the ship sails away from the harbour and the villains it hosts, your sailors mourn the plundered funds.</Text>
  <Text ID="800227">Of Unsound Mind</Text>
  <Text ID="800228">&lt;b&gt;The man spasms, eyes rolling, before finally falling unconscious.&lt;/b&gt; His mania had come suddenly, with eight men needed to pacify, and bind him to the mast. Some say he is possessed by daemons and must be done rid of. The officers, less credulous, seek a surer explanation. The only way to silence a worsening quarrel, is to find a solution.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800229">Enlist the aid of the hypnotist</Text>
  <Text ID="800234">&lt;b&gt;The crew are delighted the man has returned to his normal self.&lt;/b&gt; The hypnotist used a pendulum to induce him into deep sleep, before imparting subliminally, some choice words. Within days the fellow is happily back at work. All are buoyant that such a severe case was so artfully cured! </Text>
  <Text ID="800230">Examine the cause of this wildness in him</Text>
  <Text ID="800235">&lt;b&gt;It is a superb recovery in the circumstances.&lt;/b&gt; The examination uncovers a bluish contusion under the hair. "We are to act swiftly or he shall die!" says the doctor, as he bores a drill into the man's cranium. Once the blood is drained, the resultant hole is covered with a silver coin, and the head beswaddled with bandages. The man is fully recovered within a few days, and the crew greatly impressed by the actions of the doctor.</Text>
  <Text ID="800236">&lt;b&gt;The whole examination takes too long,&lt;/b&gt; 'though a bluish contusion is found under the hair. "I must act or he shall soon die!" gulps the doctor, but then proceeds to faff nervously through a medicine bag, until the poor man dies on the operating table. "You did the best you could," a colleague offers, but there is a hollowness to it.</Text>
  <Text ID="800237">&lt;b&gt;The patient grabs the doctor's head and smashes it against the table.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor was tapping his knee to check reflex, when the devil cut loose. "He wants putting out of his misery," a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man! </Text>
  <Text ID="800238">&lt;b&gt;Hellish horror ensues,&lt;/b&gt; as the doctor insists on checking if 'ought is stuck in the throat'. As he prises open the lion's jaws, the daemon creature lurches up into his throat. So frenzied is this vampiric assault, that there is little the crew can do but to raise their pistols to the gruesomeness. When the gunsmoke clears, doctor and patient lie dead, entwined and contorted beneath a bloody dew.</Text>
  <Text ID="800231">Try to calm the crew, and pray the man recovers</Text>
  <Text ID="800239">&lt;b&gt;The crew are convinced&lt;/b&gt; by the chaplain that god has a plan for this man. They agree to bind him to his bed while the chaplain prays for his fast recovery. After two weeks he still suffers gaps in his memory, and a paralysis of the face, but   thanks are given to the lord above that he is otherwise his usual self.</Text>
  <Text ID="800240">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are partially convinced&lt;/b&gt; there is a spiritual explanation for his deranged behavior, but insist on chaining him to his bed. "He must have done something terrible in the eyes of God," they say. Despite all hope for his fast recovery, he dies not two days later, his malady forever a mystery.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800241">&lt;b&gt;The faithless crew will not trust this to God,&lt;/b&gt; but can neither agree if the possessed man should be thrown to sea, as desired by the sailors, or permitted a chance to see out his ordeal, as demanded by the officers.</Text>
  <Text ID="800242">Side with the officers and warn the sailors to cooperate or suffer the consequences</Text>
  <Text ID="800244">&lt;b&gt;The sailors would not dare mutiny,&lt;/b&gt; of course, and return to their stations. At first they fear the bed-ridden man will commit some terrible act while they sleep. But they need not have worried, since he dies of the unexplained malady not two days later.</Text>
  <Text ID="800245">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are outraged&lt;/b&gt; and their response is immediate. In greater numbers they overwhelm and restrain the officers, while the sickly subject of their fury is bound and thrown into the deep. Confidence in the leadership of the expedition is undermined and the possibility of further trouble seems never far away.</Text>
  <Text ID="800243">Convince the officers the needs of the many must prevail over the needs of the few</Text>
  <Text ID="800246">&lt;b&gt;No officer can deny the logic of the argument,&lt;/b&gt; yet, when the man is bound and thrown overboard they cannot help but show their grief it is for no fault of his own, and that none had knowledge with which to better help him. </Text>
  <Text ID="800247">&lt;b&gt;"It's a bally disgrace! You dishonour a gentleman!"&lt;/b&gt; say the officers, as the man is bound and thrown overboard, "such incompetence shall be reported to the highest authority!" Not only is a man lost, but the expedition brought into disrepute.       </Text>
  <Text ID="800232">Guard him round the clock in his cabin</Text>
  <Text ID="800248">&lt;b&gt;There was little for the guards to report,&lt;/b&gt; but occasionally 'quelling the maddog' with liquor. After a fortnight, the poor man recovers with no recollection of anything, and while his hand is partially paralysed, he is still able to perform his usual duties.</Text>
  <Text ID="800249">&lt;b&gt;The damn guards are found with sacks over their heads.&lt;/b&gt; They swear they did not see their attacker, but weakly-tied hands suggest collusion. Of course the patient's bed is vacant, and he seems to be missing, permanently. After that, rumours circulate, and no-one seems to have any trust in anyone else.</Text>
  <Text ID="800233">Ignore the officers and get rid of him before it's too late</Text>
  <Text ID="800250">&lt;b&gt;The officers react with disgust to your decision to toss him overboard,&lt;/b&gt; and state in no uncertain terms that the whole matter will be reported. But the sailors are quite obviously relieved that his demonic presence has been exorcised. </Text>
  <Text ID="800663">The Seven-Year Itch</Text>
  <Text ID="800664">&lt;b&gt;The crew are beset by insatiable and painful itching!&lt;/b&gt; From lieutenants down to pigeon-keepers, they twist and turn in their bunks and cannot sleep. It is affecting their capacity to carry out the most basic duties, something must be done!</Text>
  <Text ID="800665">Wash more often!</Text>
  <Text ID="800669">&lt;b&gt;Washing a splendid idea at sea? Who knew?!&lt;/b&gt; The itching is very soon forgotten, as the sailors cavort through rainbows of expurgating bubbles. The rich perfume below deck is a welcome reminder of family and bygone days.</Text>
  <Text ID="800666">Analyze the symptoms</Text>
  <Text ID="800670">&lt;b&gt;"Only jellyfish!" says the cultivated doctor cheerfully.&lt;/b&gt; "Our refreshing swim at that cove appears to be the cause. It must have been rife with their larvae!" The crew marvel at the clever diagnosis, and as the itching subsides, bask in the pioneering case-study they have performed for the benefit of humankind. </Text>
  <Text ID="800671">&lt;b&gt;The red welts seem to perplex the doctor.&lt;/b&gt; "There is evidence of the parasitic," he splutters as he peers through his magnifying glass, "but then it could be nothing at all!"</Text>
  <Text ID="800673">Examine the cabins for some sort of parasite</Text>
  <Text ID="800675">&lt;b&gt;There are bedbugs everywhere!&lt;/b&gt; There must be something that can be done to exterminate these disc-bodied hangers-on!</Text>
  <Text ID="800677">Refurbish the cabins</Text>
  <Text ID="800679">&lt;b&gt;The matter is craftily "put-to-bed".&lt;/b&gt; Despite the time-consuming upheaval, the crew are surprised to have their cabins so well refurbished. "They're too soft on us," says a jolly cove inspecting the new bunks, "but my britches haven't itched all day."</Text>
  <Text ID="800680">"&lt;b&gt;What dreary decor!"&lt;/b&gt; says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. "I'd rather have the itching back," says an exhausted-looking sailor. Like others, he has to sleep out on the hard decking, until some competent craftsmen can come aboard.</Text>
  <Text ID="800678">Simply change the sheets</Text>
  <Text ID="800681">&lt;b&gt;It is a job half-done.&lt;/b&gt; For most the problem goes away, but  some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.</Text>
  <Text ID="800676">&lt;b&gt;They cannot see the wood for the trees!&lt;/b&gt; Evidence of fleas would be everywhere to the right pair of eyes. Two weeks pass, and murine typhus breaks out. Rashes, fever and vomiting grip the fleas' hosts, who are never able to find the cause of their itching agony. </Text>
  <Text ID="800674">Have the afflicted bathe in holy water</Text>
  <Text ID="800682">&lt;b&gt;The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.&lt;/b&gt; "This water is indeed holy!" he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. "Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep," he cackles.</Text>
  <Text ID="800683">&lt;b&gt;"Is nothing sacred anymore?"&lt;/b&gt; Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. "The lord hath bigger fish to fry," he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.</Text>
  <Text ID="800672">&lt;b&gt;The doctor is a demented quack.&lt;/b&gt; When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution. Needless to say, his victims do not survive their injuries. When the expedition returns, it is entirely possible he may be stripped of his profession. </Text>
  <Text ID="800667">Find somewhere to stop and be rid of it</Text>
  <Text ID="800684">&lt;b&gt;Sand and sun is a panacea!&lt;/b&gt; An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="800685">&lt;b&gt;Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.&lt;/b&gt; The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?</Text>
  <Text ID="800687">Lie that the sickness isn't contagious</Text>
  <Text ID="800690">&lt;b&gt;The lie works like a charm.&lt;/b&gt; A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. "Crabs," the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.</Text>
  <Text ID="800692">&lt;b&gt;It is obvious you are lying,&lt;/b&gt; and the authorities are not impressed. They allow several days to pass, without any word on your ship's release, adversely affecting the morale of your crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="800688"> Threaten them into letting you go</Text>
  <Text ID="800693">&lt;b&gt;They don't want any trouble.&lt;/b&gt; A doctor comes aboard ship and goes nervously about his business. Although the atmosphere is somewhat cagey, medicines for your crew's skin conditions are provided, and the expedition can continue on its way.</Text>
  <Text ID="800694">&lt;b&gt;You underestimate them.&lt;/b&gt; Two surprise warships hove round the landspit and close in to firing range. There is no choice but to run. As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="800689">Await quarantine</Text>
  <Text ID="800695">&lt;b&gt;It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,&lt;/b&gt; with beaurocracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.</Text>
  <Text ID="800686">&lt;b&gt;It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.&lt;/b&gt; The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight. Meanwhile the assassin bugs continue to spread their dreadful disease. Even they'd probably make better navigators! Then there wouldn't have to be quite so much death!</Text>
  <Text ID="800668">Let them itch, it's common at sea</Text>
  <Text ID="800696">&lt;b&gt;It is a particularly awful itch however.&lt;/b&gt; The disgusting lice infesting the ship, and discomfort thereof has many questioning the worth of your expedition. There is only so much scratching a crew can take before they lose all appetite for the journey ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="800875">Parasitic Infestation</Text>
  <Text ID="800877">&lt;b&gt;These parasites must have come from the marsh goo;&lt;/b&gt; all that waist-high wading. Now they nestle deep in your crew, who, at risk of harm from their own madcap cures, really need professional help!</Text>
  <Text ID="800878">Bathe them in alcohol</Text>
  <Text ID="800879">Treat the afflicted</Text>
  <Text ID="800880">Hope the problem goes away</Text>
  <Text ID="800881">&lt;b&gt;A delectable disinfectant!&lt;/b&gt; The suffering take immense pleasure scouring themselves in a whacking great tub of the stuff. Indeed, so diverting is this new form of alcohol absorption, that even those without parasites take turns.</Text>
  <Text ID="800882">&lt;b&gt;The doctor concocts a panacea&lt;/b&gt;, which not only purges the belly-dwelling roundworm, but more besides. Garlic, wormwood, and lemon quietly see off a myriad other complaints of your spoon-dodging sailors.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800883">&lt;b&gt;The doctors disagree.&lt;/b&gt; "Madam! Bloodletting gives our patients only a fifty-fifty chance!" says one. "Sir, tinctures are seldom beneficial OR effective on parasites!" says the other.</Text>
  <Text ID="800884">&lt;b&gt;It does go away, eventually.&lt;/b&gt; "My arm looked like a wormcake for a while," one sailor laments, "but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war."</Text>
  <Text ID="800885">&lt;b&gt;Mass amputation for all?!&lt;/b&gt; The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!</Text>
  <Text ID="800886">Try the latest tincture</Text>
  <Text ID="800887">Risk bloodletting the patients</Text>
  <Text ID="800888">Let nature take its course </Text>
  <Text ID="800889">&lt;b&gt;A fine placebo.&lt;/b&gt; As if by magic, the intestinal worms lose the will to go on. The doctor freely admits this is more likely down to positive patient attitude, than his revolting tincture. </Text>
  <Text ID="800890">&lt;b&gt;The unpleasant medicine doesn't help.&lt;/b&gt; Constant trips to the privy are now the only release for your bug-ridden crew. The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhea.</Text>
  <Text ID="800891">The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.</Text>
  <Text ID="800892">&lt;b&gt;Somehow it works&lt;/b&gt;, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, "human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be." A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!</Text>
  <Text ID="800893">&lt;b&gt;Perfect preparation for amputation!&lt;/b&gt; At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.</Text>
  <Text ID="800894">&lt;b&gt;It does go away, eventually.&lt;/b&gt; "My arm looked like a wormcake for a while," one sailor laments, "but that little smattering of holes filled-up with pus now - signs my body is winning the war."</Text>
  <Text ID="800895">&lt;b&gt;Mass amputation for all?!&lt;/b&gt; The festering parasites have gnawed their way to bone! Limbs must be chopped, or else their bodies shall rattle with bemaggoted cavities!</Text>
  <Text ID="800898">Have the doctor amputate</Text>
  <Text ID="800900">Let nature take its course</Text>
  <Text ID="800901">&lt;b&gt;As good as could be expected.&lt;/b&gt; Out with parasites, in with polished peg legs and helpful hook-hands. The crew look not nearly as enthusiastic as you might think however.</Text>
  <Text ID="800902">&lt;b&gt;Extraordinary that you trusted that quack!&lt;/b&gt; She is sideshow surgeon, carving up her victims with the zeal of a ripper, and the accuracy of a pissing schoolboy. At least the screams will die away soon enough...</Text>
  <Text ID="800903">&lt;b&gt;Nothing can save them.&lt;/b&gt; Though a mercy that they may choose their manner of death - unmolested by the ship's quack - it is death nonetheless. The parasite has sucked the life from your expedition. </Text>
  <Text ID="802083">The Broken Mast</Text>
  <Text ID="802084">&lt;b&gt;Sailor under the mast!&lt;/b&gt; Weeks of harsh weather have taken their toll on the ship and the violent gusts of wind of this morning have toppled the mizzenmast. For a moment the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there is only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.</Text>
  <Text ID="802085">Cover the leg with a mix of water and soap and pull it away</Text>
  <Text ID="802088">&lt;b&gt;The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.&lt;/b&gt; The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.</Text>
  <Text ID="802086">Cut the leg with a bone saw</Text>
  <Text ID="802089">&lt;b&gt;An extreme but commendable choice.&lt;/b&gt; The sailor is given rum to drink and cloth to bite before he is held in place, his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth and he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels that they are in capable hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="802090">&lt;b&gt;Butchery.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags in the flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might ever need his help in the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="802087">Lift the mast with a makeshift lever</Text>
  <Text ID="802091">&lt;b&gt;The man is freed.&lt;/b&gt; Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits the sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening and gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.</Text>
  <Text ID="802092">&lt;b&gt;The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movement to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.</Text>
  <Text ID="802710">Message In A Bottle</Text>
  <Text ID="802711">&lt;b&gt;Castaways request your help, but where could they be?&lt;/b&gt; Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors. Their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected: in its belly was a bottle and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.</Text>
  <Text ID="802712">Examine the entrails of the shark for clues</Text>
  <Text ID="802715">&lt;b&gt;The stomach of the shark reveals where it's been.&lt;/b&gt; Glittering corals, exotic scales, characteristic fish bones. Your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm the destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come closer. The water is shallower than usual and filled with sharp coral reefs.</Text>
  <Text ID="802718">Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs</Text>
  <Text ID="802720">&lt;b&gt;Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!&lt;/b&gt; The vessel groans as it swims through the limpid waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach and sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802721">&lt;b&gt;The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.&lt;/b&gt; Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew is forced to turn its back to the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.</Text>
  <Text ID="802719">Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways</Text>
  <Text ID="802722">&lt;b&gt;Found them!&lt;/b&gt; Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways and comes back filled to the brim with men in overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed faces. Their captain pledges himself to your crew and, once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors and even better companions.</Text>
  <Text ID="802723">&lt;b&gt;The look-out draws a blank.&lt;/b&gt; Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realizes that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.</Text>
  <Text ID="802724">&lt;b&gt;The homemade autopsy is a mess.&lt;/b&gt; The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he created.</Text>
  <Text ID="802725">Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails</Text>
  <Text ID="802727">&lt;b&gt;Relentless faith guides the most deserving.&lt;/b&gt; In the spilled gut of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious and their captain promises to serve your crew!</Text>
  <Text ID="802728">&lt;b&gt;There is nothing to find but deceit.&lt;/b&gt; Your cooper burns sage among the remains of the shark and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802726">Divination? Let's just stop now</Text>
  <Text ID="802729">&lt;b&gt;Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors protest against the rash decision and would have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least keep the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunt them for a while.</Text>
  <Text ID="802713">Map the islands matching the partial coordinates</Text>
  <Text ID="802730">&lt;b&gt;The search defines a searchable area.&lt;/b&gt; Many islands match the latitude but much less could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaway. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.</Text>
  <Text ID="802731">&lt;b&gt;Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to find a proper searching method and define a list of reasonable proportions, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It is said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.</Text>
  <Text ID="802714">There's no time to spare for such things</Text>
  <Text ID="802732">&lt;b&gt;The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle and the castaways are soon forgotten.</Text>
  <Text ID="802734">The Mad Preacher</Text>
  <Text ID="802735">&lt;b&gt;Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.&lt;/b&gt; Blaming the expedition's mishaps and hazards on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.</Text>
  <Text ID="802736">Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness</Text>
  <Text ID="802739">&lt;b&gt;The man of faith belongs to an asylum.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, desire for control, desire to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802740">&lt;b&gt;The doctor only proves his own paranoia.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802737">Discredit him in a direct confrontation</Text>
  <Text ID="802741">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat has a greater way with words.&lt;/b&gt; She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.</Text>
  <Text ID="802742">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.&lt;/b&gt; She confronts the preacher before the crew and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he had built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802738">Simply punish him without taking measures against his ideas</Text>
  <Text ID="802743">&lt;b&gt;Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.</Text>
  <Text ID="802799">The Night In Jail</Text>
  <Text ID="802800">&lt;b&gt;Behind bars!&lt;/b&gt; The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not a willed one. Obscure laws were breached and your whole crew was arrested under the pretence that borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail, and after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?</Text>
  <Text ID="802801">Poison the guards!</Text>
  <Text ID="802804">&lt;b&gt;Two guards are not enough to resist your science.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!</Text>
  <Text ID="802806">Disguise as guards and escort the rest of the crew</Text>
  <Text ID="802808">&lt;b&gt;The escape is flawless.&lt;/b&gt; Two of your sailors don the guards' uniforms and drag the rest of the chained crew through the prison. When they are stopped at the exit, they mimic the local accent, briefly explain the liberation, and kick one of the chained sailors for good measure. The legitimate wardens buy the lie! It takes an even greater effort to refrain from laughing before reaching the ship and leaving the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="802809">&lt;b&gt;An attempt way beyond their ability.&lt;/b&gt; Two sailors put on the guards' uniforms and lead the crew through the prison, until legitimate guards stop them and enquire about the strange cortege. The disguised men's fidgety attitude and suspiciously foreign accent is enough to convince the wardens to check their original cell: the bodies are found and with them comes the heavy charge of murder. The following day, the trial is held.</Text>
  <Text ID="802812">Offer to pay a fine, however high it might be</Text>
  <Text ID="802814">The judges give your captain a stern look</Text>
  <Text ID="802815">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="802817">&lt;b&gt;The price is high, but fair.&lt;/b&gt; Most of the expedition's budget is squandered in the brutal fine and if the crew is cleared of their charges, they find themselves forced to ration their supplies for the rest of the trip. The doctor and his accursed ideas are blamed and the man is turned into a scapegoat: his rations are regularly stolen, damaging his health and abilities, and, worse, the crew blatantly avoids his treatments.</Text>
  <Text ID="802816">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802818">&lt;b&gt;Who would accept such a meager payment?&lt;/b&gt; Murder is not a subject to be triffled with and the foreign court makes its opinion clear: your crew will pay in the hardest way possible. To show that they value life more than your sailors, the judges impose a non-lethal punishment and insist on this point, devising a program of forced labour and precise observation to make sure the sailors suffer as much as possible without dying. Months of hell follow before the crew can leave.</Text>
  <Text ID="802813">Plead they were following orders and have the crew repudiate Her Majesty</Text>
  <Text ID="802819">&lt;b&gt;That lie is believable, but it doesn't erase your crew's crimes.&lt;/b&gt; The foreign judges put aside any idea of death sentence and focus on finding a punishment befitting the crime: the crew is arranged into a procession and made to cross the city in chains, while chanting the ill-will of their Queen. Their patriotism tainted, the sailors never dare to pronounce her name again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802820">&lt;b&gt;Who would believe such an obvious lie?&lt;/b&gt; Why would their Queen ask for such a menial task as poisoning overseas guards? To match the crime, the crew's lieutenants are forced to drink hemlock solutions and trapped in a single cell with the rest of the crew. The lieutenants gag and wheeze for days of agony, their skin puffing and their muscles stiffening in impossible positions until their breathing itself is locked into place. Only then are the sailors allowed to leave.</Text>
  <Text ID="802807">Avoid drawing any attention and sneak outside</Text>
  <Text ID="802821">&lt;b&gt;The perfect crime!&lt;/b&gt; Despite their numbers, your sailors manage to sneak through the prison and into the streets, where they become shadows under the moonless night. Led by your most competent hunters, they creep through back alleys and backyards until the obscurity delivers them below their ship. Feeling like the protagonists of an adventure novel and revelling in the sentiment, they leave the harbour in the gliding vessel - all lights off and no sound made.</Text>
  <Text ID="802822">&lt;b&gt;They are caught!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors' lack of discretion is awkward and it is only a matter of minutes before a patrol spots them. Without any prepared disguise or lie, they are instantly arrested and, worse, the bodies of the poisoned guards are found on the way back to their cell. The next morning, they are judged not for their meager trespassing, but for actual murder.</Text>
  <Text ID="802805">&lt;b&gt;The doctor showcases his ignorance.&lt;/b&gt; He produces a pouch of arsenic before calling the guards. When the jailers are close enough, the doctor is ready to blow the powder in their face - however, his lack of knowledge of the poison's properties backfires: the soft inhalation of the doctor is enough to bring the highly volatile poison to his lips, and he leaps back, coughing and wheezing. The guards immediately understand this was attempted murder.</Text>
  <Text ID="802802">Dig an escape tunnel!</Text>
  <Text ID="802823">&lt;b&gt;A nice display of craftsmanship.&lt;/b&gt; The crew digs a tunnel with skill, taking care of reinforcing the structure and analysing the soil's nature as they progress. They avoid the most friable sections of the city's ground and emerge on the coast, exactly as calculated. Your ship is not too far but a frigate guards it. Its lights are off, the guards might be sleeping and not actually keeping watch.</Text>
  <Text ID="802827">Stealthily sail away</Text>
  <Text ID="802829">&lt;b&gt;Swift as a whisper.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors embark on the ship and deploy its sails in an excruciatingly slow manner, timing their flapping and clinking with the melody of the backwash. The vessel creaks softly and lets the sea take it, drifting away from the harbour with delicate movements of to and fro - soon the city is but a point on the horizon, and the sailors allow themselves to explode in a clamour of celebration.</Text>
  <Text ID="802831">&lt;b&gt;Ridiculously visible.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tiptoe past the guarding frigate, their shadows stretching across the whole deck, their stressed whispers ringing through the night. As a testimony to their poor hunting skill, it takes a barrel in their cheeks for them to realize they have been spotted. The next morning, the judges' verdict takes into account the escape attempt and condemn half of your crew to a month of forced labour.</Text>
  <Text ID="802832">Offer to pay a fine instead</Text>
  <Text ID="802834">The judges give your captain a stern look.</Text>
  <Text ID="802835">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="802837">&lt;b&gt;Bribery is a reasonable option.&lt;/b&gt; The payment offered satisfies the judges, who agree to let your sailors go. The crew mutters about the absurd trial and its even more absurd resolution, but their relief shows.</Text>
  <Text ID="802836">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802838">&lt;b&gt;Not enough.&lt;/b&gt; The judges scoff at your attempt to bribe them with a so-called fine, and advise your crew to aim for a higher amount next time. To show they are not cheap, they extend their penalty to two months of forced labour and place the sailors under the tightest surveillance. The two months are a mixture of menial and unrewarding tasks and frequent and unwarranted whipping.</Text>
  <Text ID="802833">Force your crew into complying with the unreasonable demand</Text>
  <Text ID="802839">&lt;b&gt;The crew complies.&lt;/b&gt; Following their superiors' orders, the sailors accept the judges' penalty and fulfil their obligations to the best of their abilities. One month of forced labour seems harsh even for the local population, who supports the crew's effort and vouch for their liberation: the crew earns an early release, tired but touched by the unexpected appreciation.</Text>
  <Text ID="802840">&lt;b&gt;The crew refuses to comply.&lt;/b&gt; The insistence of your first mate cannot convince the sailors of sacrificing themselves for the good of the crew, and the heated debate that follows is cut short by the judges. If your crew cannot decide who to send into forced labour, all of them will go! Forced to submit, the crew invests its strength into one month of meaningless tasks and incessant bickering among themselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="802828">Bombard the frigate as you leave</Text>
  <Text ID="802841">&lt;b&gt;An explosive escape!&lt;/b&gt; The crew feels whole again aboard their ship, and they now have the tools to face their opponents. The loaded canons fire a volley of precise blasts on the foreign frigate and its docking harbour, setting the whole coast aflame. Your ship sails away with the blaze in its back, a vision of grandiose might which fills the sailors with pride.</Text>
  <Text ID="802842">&lt;b&gt;A failed attempt.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors lack the habits required to load the canons under the cover of the night. Misguided movements and poor knowledge of the armament makes the canons overflow with powder. When they are fired, the weapons explode and take their gunner with them, offering a loud indication of the escapees' position. The crew is seized and sent back to their cell. At dawn, the judges sentence half the crew to a month of forced labour.</Text>
  <Text ID="802825">&lt;b&gt;A dead end.&lt;/b&gt; The crew can handle basic digging, but their progress is reluctant, slowed by the constant fear of being buried in the makeshift tunnel. At the first obstacle they encounter, a large foundation pillar which blocks the way, all sailors hurriedly agree that there is nothing more to be done with the tunnel. They regain the cell, relieved.</Text>
  <Text ID="802826">&lt;b&gt;Buried alive.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have but a vague idea of how to dig an escape tunnel. They grind the earth with their bare hands, the pungent soil getting stuck under their nails and lining their clothes, hair, skin. As air comes to lack so does their judgement and the crew pushes forward, blind to the crumbling rock. The tunnel collapses on them and what few sailors were still outside are judged and released without any sentence - the death of their companions is punishment enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="802803">Prepare your defence for the upcoming trial</Text>
  <Text ID="802844">&lt;b&gt;An epic trial!&lt;/b&gt; At the first chance to speak, your crew engages in an extensive and thrilling retelling of its adventures, captivating the audience and the judges. They climb and rock benches to mimic past naval battles, embark the public by asking them timely and suspenseful questions, modify their tales according to the audience's whims. Their trespassing is made part of the story and as they retell the trial itself, the judges insist on letting them go. They leave as heroes!</Text>
  <Text ID="802849">&lt;b&gt;Your defence doesn't move the judges.&lt;/b&gt; The trial follows obscure local laws and their meandering unravelling goes beyond what your diplomat is used to. Her words stumble upon the judges' traps, and her lack of understanding of the legal subtleties of the situation is obvious to anyone. To the dismay of your crew, the judges' verdict is harsh: one month of public labour for at least half of your sailors.</Text>
  <Text ID="802851">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat is beyond awkward.&lt;/b&gt; At the trial, she interrupts the judges to insist on meaningless details and points out not your crew's innocence, but the reasons why their guilt is, to quote her, not that bad. Her lack of professionalism and conviction is irritating and the judges interrupt the hearing with a hasty judgement just to stop her. Your crew is coerced into one full month of forced labour, a disproportionate and disheartening sentence.</Text>
  <Text ID="802900">The Frozen Chasm</Text>
  <Text ID="802901">&lt;b&gt;The crevasse swallowed your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; Attempting the crossing of the mountain pass was a risk, and your crew now pays the price for their desire to test the odds. The rocky path turned to frozen snow, then to the still body of a glacier, its ominous presence plaguing the air with the smell of winter. Night swelled faster than anticipated and it didn't take long for the less cautious explorers to discover the frailty of ice mantles.</Text>
  <Text ID="802902">Build a snow anchor to descend into the crevasse</Text>
  <Text ID="802905">&lt;b&gt;The snow anchor is a reliable solution.&lt;/b&gt; Your explorers rope themselves together, passing a safety line of sturdy hemp around their waists, through the mound of packed snow, and into the hands of selected athletes. They control the rope as the rescue team expertly climbs down. The fallen sailors are in poor condition, and the feeble light and jagged walls do not hint at an easy rescue.</Text>
  <Text ID="802907">Bind their broken limbs with splints and help them climb</Text>
  <Text ID="802909">&lt;b&gt;The best course of action for a most hazardous situation.&lt;/b&gt; The splints are not only immobilizing, but supporting the wounded limbs of the fallen sailors, and with the help of their rescuers, they manage to climb a high enough portion of the ice wall for the others to pull them up. Even the wounded, despite their shaking bodies and frozen injuries, find the strength to join the following cheer.</Text>
  <Text ID="802910">&lt;b&gt;The splints are torture devices.&lt;/b&gt; The splints are well assembled but the sailors' lack of anatomical knowledge lets them bind the splints wherever, and the wooden aids force the wounded into unnatural movements and bending poses. When the men are finally pulled up, they are in an even more dire state than after their fall.</Text>
  <Text ID="802908">Bind the wounded to the safety rope and pull them up</Text>
  <Text ID="802913">&lt;b&gt;The men are brought to safety!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors bind the wounded with a clever construction of marine knots that supports them and divides their weights across the safety rope. Pulling them up is so easy the injured can even spare a laugh while swinging across the ice wall. The successful teamwork brought your sailors closer than ever, and it is a group of brothers and sisters which brings the wounded back to the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802914">&lt;b&gt;This will never work.&lt;/b&gt; The wounded are bound to the safety rope in the roughest way possible, their injuries pressed against the coarse hemp till the fibres are coloured red. Despite the need to leave quickly, there is no way the men could be pulled up without worsening their state. Your sailors need help. Will the crew still on the ship notice their prolonged absence?</Text>
  <Text ID="802915">Send scouts in the night to find help</Text>
  <Text ID="802917">&lt;b&gt;Help at last.&lt;/b&gt; Your scouts navigate the night-filled glacier with care, marking their route with etchings in the ice. They bring back sailors and an actual pulley, which help rescuing the wounded without any more harm. The injured men are in a poor state and will probably suffer from this trial in the long term, but for now they simply savour their survival.</Text>
  <Text ID="802918">&lt;b&gt;The rescue team also faces the trials of the glacier.&lt;/b&gt; Of the two scouts sent, only one comes back, and with him a team of sailors frozen by their numerous detours and hours spent getting lost in the mountain. The pulley they bring is the perfect solution for rescuing the fallen men. The wounded are many, both among the victims and their rescuers, yet none complains: they are alive, if missing a limb or two.</Text>
  <Text ID="802916">Camp and hunt for food while waiting for rescue</Text>
  <Text ID="802919">&lt;b&gt;Sufficient supplies are found.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters are much better at crafting snares than rescue harnesses, and they gather game on a regular enough basis that the team can survive until helps finally arrives. The diet of bony rabbits wasn't enough to keep your sailors in perfect health, but a couple weeks of care and proper food should put them back on their feet.</Text>
  <Text ID="802920">&lt;b&gt;The rescue team finds their comrades famished and wasted.&lt;/b&gt; Your hunters couldn't find sufficient game in the avaricious mountain, and the diet of molten ice aggravated the wounded's condition past what they could humanely endure. The sailors stagger back to the ship, leaving two dead behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="802906">&lt;b&gt;The snow anchor fails your sailors terribly.&lt;/b&gt; For most of your crew, a snow anchor is but a vague concept. The rescuers bind themselves to a frail heap of packed snow and descend into the crevasse one by one. One, two, three men slide along the walls of ice, their weight pulling on the cracking anchor. When the fourth jumps into the rift, the anchor falls with him and with them the very edge of the ice - burying the crevasse and sealing it forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="802903">Look for another way into the crevasse</Text>
  <Text ID="802921">&lt;b&gt;A way in!&lt;/b&gt; Following the glacier and identifying its contours by the bumps and gaps of its snow cape, your sailors find a spot of crunchy and brittle ice which covers the entrance of a steep slope leading into the crevasse. The wounded men lie at its end, doing their best to muffle their whimpers of pain.</Text>
  <Text ID="802926">Carry the wounded up the slope</Text>
  <Text ID="802930">&lt;b&gt;Up they go!&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are athletes of great physical condition, and the wounded are no exception. They clench their teeth as they are pulled on their companions' back and carried up the tricky slope, helping their rescuers by balancing their movements and ignoring their gnawing pain. The morning greets them in a glorious scene of dumbfounded relief.</Text>
  <Text ID="802931">&lt;b&gt;It works, but at what cost?&lt;/b&gt; The wounded are pulled more than they are carried, their rescuers lacking both the physical and mental strength required to treat the injured with the care and delicacy they require. When the last man is pulled from the slope, a gruesome noise announces that parts of him have decided to stay in the tunnel. The body is abandoned as the crew hurries back to the ship, disgruntled.</Text>
  <Text ID="802922">&lt;b&gt;An alternate entrance is found after a long while.&lt;/b&gt; Alternate is a euphemism: the sailors went deep into the entrails of the glacier and instead of finding a way to the crevasse, they discerned a fault in the thin ice wall. Breaking it allowed them inside but their delayed arrival, rather than soothe the fallen men, triggers their ire: couldn't they have come faster? Don't they see their freezing limbs? Don't they know the fright they caused?</Text>
  <Text ID="802932">Alleviate their panic with drugs</Text>
  <Text ID="802934">&lt;b&gt;The groggy men are cooperating at last.&lt;/b&gt; A just dosage of tranquillisers tones down their panic while keeping them conscious, and the wounded let themselves be guided out of the crevasse and back to the ship. When the drugs and the cold wear out, they realise how oblivious they were to the real extent of their injuries.</Text>
  <Text ID="802935">&lt;b&gt;Their artificial calm lasts eternally.&lt;/b&gt; The dosage of tranquillisers is on the nose and doesn't even take into account the weakened state of the patients. Their panic calms down at an alarming speed, then fainting follows, then a sleep so deep it takes away their breath and their heartbeat. At least they died peacefully.</Text>
  <Text ID="802933">Talk them into a calmer behaviour</Text>
  <Text ID="802936">&lt;b&gt;They calm down and can finally be rescued.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are respectful of the wounded's pain and sympathise with them, soothing their angst with empathy and welcomed admiration. The injured swallow their insults and try to live to their companions' expectations, holding their whimpers until they are back on the ship. Their wounds are a nasty sight but their pride is beaming.</Text>
  <Text ID="802937">&lt;b&gt;Their panic soars and push them to their death.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors try to motivate the wounded through accurate descriptions of their fate, pointing at their darkened limbs and prophesying their coming fall. The injured enter a state of pure terror, screaming continuously and unable to hear themselves, crawling away from the news bearers and deeper into the chasm, until the snow dampens their screams and the sound of their final fall.</Text>
  <Text ID="802923">&lt;b&gt;The glacier forbids your sailors from finding their way through it.&lt;/b&gt; The twisting paths of the frozen structure are too much for the crew, who already encountered trouble following the main marked glacier route. They are forced to abandon their quest and must go back to the broken mantle and its crevasse. The cold steadily bites and weakens them, and they soon take the same purple tint as the men they are trying to save.</Text>
  <Text ID="802938">Have the weakened sailors try to pull the others up</Text>
  <Text ID="802940">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' best effort cannot compensate the loss of time.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's physical ability is of excellent nature, but the cold suffers no exception when it comes to eating flesh. The wounded are pulled up and the fangs of ice tear their feet and legs away, keeping these trophies as fees for the men's freedom. They are brought back to the ship but can never truly take part in the expedition again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802941">&lt;b&gt;A terrible initiative.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors slip into the crevasse, pushing and pulling the wounded up the frozen walls at the cost of what little energy they have. Their panting draws lines of mist around them and the faint clouds of breath thicken and thicken and suddenly evaporate. There is no more saving to be done for the injured and their rescuers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802939">Put the wounded out of their misery before leaving</Text>
  <Text ID="802942">&lt;b&gt;Heartbreaking.&lt;/b&gt; Could they have resolved this in any other way? Your sailors try to ignore the question while they point their guns at their companions, men too frozen now to realize what's about to happen. They die silently, and the absence of protest weighs heavier than any voiced reproach on the would-be rescuers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802904">Leave the dolts behind</Text>
  <Text ID="802943">&lt;b&gt;They had it coming.&lt;/b&gt; This is not your crew's first encounter with the dangers of the wild, yet they persisted in being foolhardy and ignored the basic rules of mountain hiking. Let their fate be a lesson for the other idiots.</Text>
  <Text ID="803044">Afraid Of The Light</Text>
  <Text ID="803045">&lt;b&gt;This man is severely ill!&lt;/b&gt; A group of sailors bang on the door to the doctor's cabin. They carry a feverish friend, who between two moments of altered sleep mutters about a burning radiance and closes his eyes to protect himself from the deck's half-light. The doctor's inspection could reveal more symptoms, but shouldn't the crazed patient be secluded instead?</Text>
  <Text ID="803046">Inspect the man at the risk of contamination</Text>
  <Text ID="803048">&lt;b&gt;The symptoms speak for themselves.&lt;/b&gt; The man's neck is stiff, his breathing distraught, his cheeks paralysed. As the doctor explains to the rest of the crew the details of meningitis, the lying patient suddenly trembles, taken by a seizure of such intensity that his whole body arches upwards, bent in a pyramidal pose of impossible tension. He screams out the name of your doctor before falling down, dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="803050">This was the delirium of a dying man</Text>
  <Text ID="803055">&lt;b&gt;There is no truth but the voice of science.&lt;/b&gt; The accusation was the plea of a sick fool. Your doctor knows what ravages meningitis can do in the mind of its victims, and his collected account of symptoms convinces your crew of your doctor's innocence and acute knowledge. He is free to inspect all men onboard and identifies who else carries the symptoms: the sick are promptly isolated and disembarked at the next harbour. Your expedition is unscathed!</Text>
  <Text ID="803056">&lt;b&gt;The doctor's truth isn't convincing.&lt;/b&gt; He fumbles through his explanations as his limited knowledge of the dead man's illness shows, and if the doctor did seem to correctly identify the ailment, he fails to justify the impressive death the crew just witnessed. Doubts linger as the expedition goes on, and the doctor spends the rest of trip isolated in a quarantine of defiance and distrust.</Text>
  <Text ID="803051">This was the accusation of a victim</Text>
  <Text ID="803057">&lt;b&gt;Heavenly truths hide in the last wishes of a man.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor is pressed for answers and asked to swear his innocence before the Lord: a feat too great and a lie to heavy for him to bear. He confesses to having poisoned the sailor with mercury over a dispute of faith against facts - ironically, the doctor's own fear of the Light made him confess his sins. He is hanged and your crew finds relief in the punishment of the murderer.</Text>
  <Text ID="803058">&lt;b&gt;Isn't this judgement too hasty?&lt;/b&gt; The doctor is immediately accused of having murdered the sick sailor, but he isn't enough of a believer to confess before the cross. He is nevertheless hanged for his supposed crimes. Relief tints the mood of your crew, but many know the punishment was hasty and unjust.</Text>
  <Text ID="803049">&lt;b&gt;Your doctor is at a loss.&lt;/b&gt; Fear of the light sounds like an ailment belonging to the realm of the Lord, and the man of science is too blinded by his fright to notice the change in his patient. In a fit of unforeseen anger, the sick man leaps on his healer and attempts to claw his eyes out before being restrained by the surrounding sailors. What madness is this?</Text>
  <Text ID="803059">Observe the evolution of the lunatic's symptoms</Text>
  <Text ID="803061">&lt;b&gt;Rabies, no doubt - confine him!&lt;/b&gt; The man's unnatural fury keeps growing under the observations of the doctor, who finally discerns familiar patterns in his patient's behaviour. The massive salivation and rejection of any form of drink leave little room for doubt: he has rabies. The sailors confine him into the hold without remorse, and wait for the illness to steal his life.</Text>
  <Text ID="803062">&lt;b&gt;The symptoms culminate in death.&lt;/b&gt; The roped patient wriggles, drooling and screeching and screaming for the lights to be gone, until a seizure of astonishing magnitude takes him and leaves his cadaver frozen in an impossible position. The doctor realizes, too late, that he might have been facing a case of rabies. Around him the crew grows restless: what if this failure of a scientist was still wrong?</Text>
  <Text ID="803063">Find evidence on the dead man's body</Text>
  <Text ID="803065">&lt;b&gt;The flesh carries proof.&lt;/b&gt; In the thigh of the dead man, your doctor discerns burn marks unlike any other, appended over a festering wound. This is the work of a priest, who applied a heated key of Saint Hubert over the bite of a rabid dog - in the hope, visibly misplaced, that the Saint would cure the ailment. The sailor had known of his fate but chose to endanger his companions regardless. He deserved death.</Text>
  <Text ID="803066">&lt;b&gt;Your crew has had enough of the doctor's incapability.&lt;/b&gt; The man of science probes the body, tearing its clothes to reveal bruised skin and vulnerable flesh - a sight which convinces the sailors that they have seen the boundaries of his skill. The doctor is seized and roped alongside the cadaver he was desecrating, and left to ponder over his calling in the depths of the hull. At the next harbour, your crew realises that the doctor's wrinkled mass will never do harm nor good again.</Text>
  <Text ID="803064">Find evidence in the dead man's belongings</Text>
  <Text ID="803067">&lt;b&gt;Undisputable evidence points to a grim story.&lt;/b&gt; The inspection of the dead man's belongings lands no result, but your sailors know better than to consider this failure as final. They extend their search to the sleeping quarters, and within the loose planks of an amateurish repair, they find their proof: a key of Saint Hubert, vital artefact for any believer suspecting the menace of rabies. The sailor knew of his ailment and chose to hide it. This truth pains your crew but the closure brings relief.</Text>
  <Text ID="803068">&lt;b&gt;No proof, no trust.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are not good hounds, especially under pressure, and they find no proof pointing to the nature of the dead man's illness. Suspicion rises as the doctor orders the immediate burial at sea of the cadaver. Long after the cloth-wrapped body was thrown into the sea, the cadaver of the dead man is found hidden in the hull. There is little doubt as to who was thrown overboard in its place.</Text>
  <Text ID="803060">Confine the madman in the hold</Text>
  <Text ID="803069">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors will have nothing to do with this lunacy.&lt;/b&gt; Sending the sick man to the depths of the hold is a cruel choice, but it lowers the risk of any otherworldly contamination. His howls bedevil the ship until his voice becomes whisper, then silence. His body is buried at sea in a hurried parody of ceremony whereas the sailors avoid discussing his unknown illness.</Text>
  <Text ID="803047">Put the fool in quarantine</Text>
  <Text ID="803070">&lt;b&gt;The sick die alone.&lt;/b&gt; Afraid of the man's state and the contagion he could potentially spread, your sailors lock him up in an emptied cabin. He opposes no resistance and during the following days, his presence is reduced to sporadic whimpers and the occasional monologue. When the voice finally dies out, the sailors carefully wrap his body in cloth and bury him at sea, both relieved and sorry that they let him die a dog's death.</Text>
  <Text ID="803072">Ghosts in the Ice</Text>
  <Text ID="803115">&lt;b&gt;A ship trapped in the floe!&lt;/b&gt; While navigating the treacherous Northern seas, your expedition happens upon frozen waters, whose masses spread over the horizon and plant their roots deep below the surface. Their dominion imprisoned a ship much like yours. Skin parched, voice torn, eyes buried deep in their skulls, the stranded sailors sacrifice their last bits of strength to beg for help.</Text>
  <Text ID="803074">Diagnose the sailors' condition</Text>
  <Text ID="803080">&lt;b&gt;Scurvy.&lt;/b&gt; When inspecting the mouths of the stranded sailors, your doctor's fingers expertly go through their gums like if they were made of paper and the teeth below quit their lodging with a shake and a pull. The ill men admit to having already buried at sea two of their own. More will follow if they do not eat fresh food soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="803082">Part with a large portion of your supplies</Text>
  <Text ID="803084">The starved sailors eye your food with envy</Text>
  <Text ID="803085">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="803087">&lt;b&gt;Your loss will help their survival, no doubt.&lt;/b&gt; The gifted supplies are enough for the strangers to hold out until rescue comes. Your crew promises to look for the nearest harbour and call for help there - a promise which they are likely to keep, forced that they will be to resupply in order to avoid their own starvation.</Text>
  <Text ID="803086">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="803088">&lt;b&gt;There are not enough supplies for both your crew and theirs.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors stop rummaging through their cargo and must deny the stranded men their hope of renewed supplies. The poor souls are too weak to vent their anger, but their empty looks and cursing whispers follow your crew long after the ghost ship has been swallowed by the horizon.</Text>
  <Text ID="803083">Hunt the floe for fresh meat</Text>
  <Text ID="803089">&lt;b&gt;The icy domain gives a profuse bounty.&lt;/b&gt; Your fishermen forsake the idea of exploring the floe, knowing that the local game hides underwater. They catch enough seals to feed the whole crew and the feast, if it does not miraculously heal the sick, seems to replenish their spirit. They encourage your crew to use cannons to break the ice encasing their ship - despite the risk of damaging their hull.</Text>
  <Text ID="803092">Blast the floe apart</Text>
  <Text ID="803094">&lt;b&gt;The ship is freed!&lt;/b&gt; Your artillery men take hold of the stranded ship's cannons, ordering the crew in their handling of the frozen artillery and coordinating them with your own firepower. The combined shots from both vessels trace the contours of the ice, breaking it with successive volleys until the floe parts and lets go under the united cheer of both crews. One of the sailors who helped shooting, taken with your crew's kindness and its brilliant skills, even offers to join it.</Text>
  <Text ID="803095">&lt;b&gt;Your shots break the ice along with their hull.&lt;/b&gt; Shooting a cannonball through the exact thickness of the ice without going any further requires a degree of control that your artillery man doesn't have. The blast pierces through the floe with a resounding crack, but the splinters projected by the impact are both ice and wood. The stranded sailors are thankful for your help and the water cushioned most of your cannonball's power, but your crew still feels guilt at seeing their ship hobble away.</Text>
  <Text ID="803093">Promise to call in help and leave</Text>
  <Text ID="803096">&lt;b&gt;Your crew promises to send help.&lt;/b&gt; They leave the stranded men after telling them of steam-powered icebreakers and expeditions versed in the art of rescuing people such as them, and the tales seem to satisfy their angst. Your sailors hope that the next harbour will indeed provide such saviours.</Text>
  <Text ID="803090">&lt;b&gt;The hunters can't find enough food.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors manage to track, find and trap seals but the bounty is not enough to feed a whole crew of ailing men. It might be enough for them to hold out until the arrival of a rescue mission - if there were less of them, or if they followed a strict rationing discipline.</Text>
  <Text ID="803097">Invite as many as you can onboard</Text>
  <Text ID="803099">&lt;b&gt;They are desperate for help and accept your proposal.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomat pressures the strangers more than she reassures them, and her pragmatic approach to the problem manages to convince them. About a third of the sick embark on your ship whereas the remaining sailors huddle together to share the meagre food that was hunted for them. Going back and forth between the closest harbour and the trapped ship drains your crew and your time, but the rescued men are indefinitely grateful.</Text>
  <Text ID="803100">&lt;b&gt;Your diplomat cannot convince them to commit self-sacrifice.&lt;/b&gt; Rather than depicting the reasons behind your crew's decision, she bluntly announces the number of strangers allowed on board, and sparks an immediate frenzy. The skeletal men rise on trembling legs, their limbs pulled forward by the puppet strings of hunger, rushing into each other until most strings are cut. The culled crew climbs aboard your ship and their soulless presence plagues the rest of the expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="803098">Order and enforce strict rationing</Text>
  <Text ID="803101">&lt;b&gt;The system is strict but allows them to hold their ground.&lt;/b&gt; One of your officers and two of your biggest, most impressive sailors go down on the stranded ship to distribute food portions and teach the men about the merits and secrets of disciplined rationing. The crew nods their understanding, silent as your ship sails away. Hopefully they will follow your advice and most will still be alive when a rescue ship comes to their aid.</Text>
  <Text ID="803102">&lt;b&gt;Your frail discipline falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; One of your officers and a handful of escorting sailors order the starved men to ration the meat lest they suffer from even more famine while your ship goes to look for help. Their lack of presence and conviction has no impact on the sailors, who throw themselves on the supplies and transform into beasts, frail animals who lack the strength to rip each other apart despite their will to do so. Your ship leaves in a hurry, leaving the fools to their madness.</Text>
  <Text ID="803091">&lt;b&gt;The floe is barren.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to catch any game on the frozen ice and the surrounding hills of snow despite the numerous tracks sprinkling the area, your hunters come back empty-handed and ashamed. The stranded sailors appreciate the effort but their eyes grow duller still. They are still desperate for any kind of help.</Text>
  <Text ID="803081">&lt;b&gt;The unknown illness might attack your crew.&lt;/b&gt; Your doctor cannot pierce the mystery of the strangers' ailment: their ghost-like bodies fascinate as much as they terrify. Too scared to properly inspect their cadaverous skin, he hurriedly affirms that any sort of prolonged contact with them would put your own sailors in danger. Your ship whisks your crew away from the imaginary threat, leaving the strangers to die.</Text>
  <Text ID="803077">Break the floe with your cannons</Text>
  <Text ID="803103">&lt;b&gt;A job carried with few hitches.&lt;/b&gt; Making sure that they do not damage the ship itself, your sailors fire cannonball after cannonball, taking the time to appraise an readjust their aim with each new shot. The ship's hull is grazed by the first shots and soon the floe parts before the vessel, the ice blocks gliding against each other with menacing cracks. The trapped crew profusely thanks yours! Your sailors revel in their saviour act, trying to ignore the emaciated faces and feeble voices.</Text>
  <Text ID="803104">&lt;b&gt;Reckless failure.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors have no notion of subtlety and even less understanding of their own firepower: the very first cannonball crashes into the ice and flies through the water and into the trapped hull below. Frozen foam explodes and stains the floe with streaks of grey which all point at the gaping hole in the wooden frame. The stranded crew trembles back and forth to secure the leak and refuses any more help.</Text>
  <Text ID="803105">Share supplies as an apology</Text>
  <Text ID="803107">Can we spare enough supplies for them?</Text>
  <Text ID="803108">Confirm</Text>
  <Text ID="803110">&lt;b&gt;The best that could have been done.&lt;/b&gt; The strangers accept your sailors' offer with reluctance, eyeing the leakage they caused more than the food they offer. The compensation is enough to put your own crew in the need of rationing but it does not absolve its mistakes. Your ship leaves with promises to call for help at the next harbour, eager to leave the judging stares.</Text>
  <Text ID="803109">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="803111">&lt;b&gt;The situation gets as bad as it could.&lt;/b&gt; Enraged by your retraction, the stranded crew flings resounding insults at your crew, then splinters from the broken hull, then the crates they had prepared to store your offering, then actual men. Fuelled by their ire and moving despite their cadaverous state, the assailants fire at will, oblivious to the retort of your crew. When the wraiths finally give in to death, your officers start to count the bodies.</Text>
  <Text ID="803106">They can take care of themselves, leave</Text>
  <Text ID="803112">&lt;b&gt;Your crew leaves the stranded men to fend for themselves.&lt;/b&gt; There's no mistaking the leak for a negligible issue: if the skeletal state of the sailors is any indication, they will never have the strength to fix their ship. Allowing them to keep their pride might have been the granting of a last wish.</Text>
  <Text ID="803078">Ignore their plea and leave</Text>
  <Text ID="803113">&lt;b&gt;The strangers are left to their grim fate.&lt;/b&gt; One of your sailors crystallises your crew's fears by signing himself as the trapped ship disappears in the distance. The wraiths onboard were so close to death they had already taken its guise.</Text>
  <Text ID="800171">The Inspector</Text>
  <Text ID="800172"> &lt;b&gt;"I do hope you've nothing to hide?"&lt;/b&gt; smirks the Royal Inspector, as his soldiers help him aboard from the row boat. Sailors twitch. Your ship is certain to contravene her majesty's law, since it has encroached into demilitarised waters.</Text>
  <Text ID="800173">Quickly forge an official document</Text>
  <Text ID="800177"> &lt;b&gt;"Very good"&lt;/b&gt;, grimaces the Royal Inspector, scarcely concealing his displeasure at having to let you off the hook. His remonstrations with his soldiers as he wobbles aboard the row boat are a great source of amusement for the crew in days to come. </Text>
  <Text ID="800174">Threaten him and his soldiers</Text>
  <Text ID="800178">&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's lip wobbles.&lt;/b&gt; "I beg you," he says, "I have a gift, if only you will spare us." Sure enough, the gift is brought aboard as promised. But it is only once the Inspector and his soldiers are gone, that it feels safe enough to inspect the new acquisition.</Text>
  <Text ID="800179">&lt;b&gt;The Inspector's face pales&lt;/b&gt; as he eyes the tigerish crew. He bows, and takes a half-step backward - a signal for his soldiers to disembark with him. Once gone, the crew breathe a great sigh of relief, knowing it to have been a close shave.</Text>
  <Text ID="800180">&lt;b&gt;"This is far from over!"&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector snarls as he evacuates his men to the row boat. Sure enough, back aboard the royal clipper, he is seen making preparations to attack. </Text>
  <Text ID="800185">Set sail and try to outrun them</Text>
  <Text ID="800187">&lt;b&gt;Slippery as an eel,&lt;/b&gt; steady navigation keeps your ship on the windward side, just out of the Inspector's clutches. After a tense pursuit he is forced to give up, to the crew's great relief.</Text>
  <Text ID="800188">&lt;b&gt;Though the ungainly clipper is outmanoeuvered,&lt;/b&gt; the expedition is now many miles off course, and your ship's exhausted navigators must summon all their remaining stamina to get things back on track.    </Text>
  <Text ID="800189">&lt;b&gt;It's upsetting that the Inspector's clipper&lt;/b&gt; is near out of sight, when a hopeful last shot finds its mark, crashing in the main deck of your ship, and killing a luckless sailor. Despite having escaped, the crew are rattled by such ill luck.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800190">&lt;b&gt;Complete confusion among the navigators&lt;/b&gt; makes your ship a sitting duck, and the Inspector's clipper gleefully riddles it with cannonfire. Many die or are wounded, and the ship is left in shreds.</Text>
  <Text ID="800186">Sink the toad!</Text>
  <Text ID="800191">&lt;b&gt;The last they expect is a quick counter.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised and windless, they're an easy mark. Your cannons flog the Inspector's clipper without reply, and before long, it is bubbling to the depths. The relieved crew scout the flotsam for spoils.</Text>
  <Text ID="800192">&lt;b&gt;Though the royal clipper has it worse,&lt;/b&gt; it also deals significant damage to your ship in the chaotic exchange. With casualties and repairs on both sides, the ships agree to part, so that they may lick their wounds.</Text>
  <Text ID="800193">&lt;b&gt;The speed and power of the royal clipper&lt;/b&gt; is impossible to match despite best efforts. Your ship takes significant damage, and a young sailor is killed by shrapnel. Retreat is the only option. Mercifully the Inspector chooses not to make pursuit.</Text>
  <Text ID="800194">&lt;b&gt;The superior clipper chews through your ship&lt;/b&gt; with its dread bank of cannons - the ruthless Inspector intent on bringing traitors to their knees. "We surrender!" the crew cry, but the plea falls on deaf ears. Once he has shredded the ship to bits, the smug Inspector turns his clipper about, and disappears into the distance.</Text>
  <Text ID="800181">&lt;b&gt;There is a commotion&lt;/b&gt; and the Inspector's soldiers are already among the crew. Being exceptionally well-drilled, they quickly force the crew to drop their weapons. "Now," says the Inspector, "if you are quite finished, I'd like to continue my inspection of your vessel!" </Text>
  <Text ID="800195">Allow him to inspect the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800197">&lt;b&gt;"Though this appears to be a trade vessel,"&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector says, "Combat was a consideration when these sails were fashioned - unacceptable in Her Majesty's seas. Unless..." he winks grotesquely, "...we can come to some arrangement?"</Text>
  <Text ID="800198">Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text>
  <Text ID="800200">&lt;b&gt;"Load these crates aboard the clipper!&lt;/b&gt; What are you waiting for?" he huffs to his men. When they are done, he smirks and offers the merest of bows, before sailing away with the plunder.</Text>
  <Text ID="800199">Take consequences</Text>
  <Text ID="800201">&lt;b&gt;"You will remain here until they are dismantled..."&lt;/b&gt; trills the Inspector, "...those perverse modifications to your sails contravening sovereign law of the sea." As the nit-picking Inspector leaves, it is clear an arduous refit is needed before your expedition will be allowed to continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="800196">&lt;b&gt;"This is obviously a military vessel,"&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector says, "in sovereign sea subject to the amnesty." He toys with the gold button of his greatcoat. "There will be severe consequences, unless... I hope you don't intend to offer me a bribe?"</Text>
  <Text ID="800202">Trade with the Inspector (Bribe)</Text>
  <Text ID="800203">Take consequences</Text>
  <Text ID="800205">&lt;b&gt;"I don't know what you were thinking,&lt;/b&gt; bringing an armed ship into these peaceful waters," he says. "but I take great pleasure in imposing upon you. the longest possible route around." Once the Inspector has gone, the crew look to one another in dismay.</Text>
  <Text ID="800182">&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector calls three captive sailors forward. "Hang these men," he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text>
  <Text ID="800184">&lt;b&gt;A disastrous melee ensues,&lt;/b&gt; in which the crew do not acquit themselves well. Some are skewered, the rest disarmed. The Inspector picks out the captive specialist. "Hang this traitor," he says, and promptly strings them from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text>
  <Text ID="800175">Talk him out of the inspection</Text>
  <Text ID="800206">&lt;b&gt;"Rather excellent company",&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector over a glass of port, "I've been dying for something to break the tedium of the sea." Surprising even his own soldiers, the Inspector demands a gift be brought over from the clipper to mark the occasion. Of course, when he finally leaves, the crew collapse about in relief.</Text>
  <Text ID="800207">&lt;b&gt;"Very well,"&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, after being given the first mate's 'special tour' of nothing in particular. He silently surveys the vessel for a torturous moment, before declaring "it all seems above board." Of course, as soon as he and his soldiers have disembarked, the crew of your ship collapse about in grievous relief.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800208">&lt;b&gt;"Save your breath, windbag,"&lt;/b&gt; says the Inspector, with an air of a man accustomed to weaseling. "Show me the damn ship, or I shall become vexed!"</Text>
  <Text ID="800209">&lt;b&gt;"You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,"&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, pointing to three unlucky sailors. "Hang them," he says, and they are promptly strung from a beam until dead. Your ship, he decrees, must leave sovereign waters and take the long way round.</Text>
  <Text ID="800210">&lt;b&gt;"You've talked yourself into very serious trouble,"&lt;/b&gt; the Inspector sneers, and points at your specialist.

  <Text ID="801607">The Trial</Text>
  <Text ID="801609">&lt;b&gt;The crew faces the bloody customs of foreign lands.&lt;/b&gt; After a night of feasting, the sailors believe that meeting the foreign prince and his sea-traveling court is the highlight of their trip. However, morning comes with news of a sudden death among the court, and your crew is immediately accused of murder. The prince demands a trial by combat and your men are left with little freedom but the choice of the challenge's nature.</Text>
  <Text ID="801610">Send your strongest fighter for a brawl</Text>
  <Text ID="801613">&lt;b&gt;What could a lord do against a sea-forged champion?&lt;/b&gt; The prince's warrior is nothing more than a scarecrow in shiny armor, and your own cotton-clad fighter scoffs at his tacky opponent. The walking wardrobe is tripped, grabbed, and thrown overboard in a single movement. As per foreign laws, your crew receives compensation and their name is cleared.</Text>
  <Text ID="801614">&lt;b&gt;No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.&lt;/b&gt; If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.</Text>
  <Text ID="801611">Send your best shot for a pistol duel</Text>
  <Text ID="801615">&lt;b&gt;Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.&lt;/b&gt; His opponent drop to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offense.</Text>
  <Text ID="801616">&lt;b&gt;Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.&lt;/b&gt; The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen. Your best shot is dead before he even touches the handle of his gun. Judging his passing to be too low a price, the prince randomly selects men among your crew and has them hanged for good measure.</Text>
  <Text ID="801612">Send your brightest officer for a trial of wits</Text>
  <Text ID="801617">&lt;b&gt;The foreigners are drawn in by your officer's pace.&lt;/b&gt; He inspects the body, noticing knife cuts of varying depths and bleeding. Through methodical questioning, the officer presses the foreigners and reveals the deception: each wound was made by a different hand, the victim was killed by all of them! The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.</Text>
  <Text ID="801618">&lt;b&gt;A mute would have pleaded better.&lt;/b&gt; The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary. The prince cuts the exchange with exasperation and has the officer taken to be quartered till torn apart as a final judgement for the supposed crime. No scream ever matches the ones heard that day.</Text>
  <Text ID="802020">Tavern Troubles</Text>
  <Text ID="802021">&lt;b&gt;These hoodlums are asking for it.&lt;/b&gt; To each harbour its own ill-famed tavern, and this one is no exception. While your crew enjoys a beer at the counter, the tavern's door slams open, the bartender stiffens and the volume of conversations dwindles: the newcomers are regulars of the bad kind. One of the scruffy men elbows your doctor and gasps as the alcohol splashes on his unkempt clothes. He immediately grabs your sailor by the collar and demands an apology.</Text>
  <Text ID="802022">They want to fight? Let them come!</Text>
  <Text ID="802025">&lt;b&gt;Your crew crushes them.&lt;/b&gt; The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him above his shoulder, sending him to crash into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action and the bartender offers a round to celebrate the deserved beating.</Text>
  <Text ID="802026">&lt;b&gt;The crew overestimated themselves.&lt;/b&gt; As he calls for the other sailors to help, the doctor gets his head smashed into the counter. His crewmates scream for revenge and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.</Text>
  <Text ID="802023">Offer them a drink to ease the tension</Text>
  <Text ID="802027">&lt;b&gt;The language of alcohol is universal.&lt;/b&gt; The thugs take you up on your offer and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="802029">Show them the drinking ability of seafarers</Text>
  <Text ID="802031">&lt;b&gt;They call that catpiss strong?&lt;/b&gt; There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew is still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.</Text>
  <Text ID="802032">&lt;b&gt;What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?&lt;/b&gt; The crew is used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.</Text>
  <Text ID="802030">Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation</Text>
  <Text ID="802033">&lt;b&gt;War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.&lt;/b&gt; After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notices the drop in attention of their opponents and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.</Text>
  <Text ID="802034">&lt;b&gt;The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.&lt;/b&gt; The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, loses control of their movements and tumbles against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, murderers of their opponents.</Text>
  <Text ID="802028">&lt;b&gt;Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink and way more than your sailors can afford.</Text>
  <Text ID="802035">If it's a fight they want, they'll get one</Text>
  <Text ID="802036">Pay up</Text>
  <Text ID="802037">&lt;b&gt;The crew is humiliated.&lt;/b&gt; They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.</Text>
  <Text ID="802024">This is a waste of time, simply apologize</Text>
  <Text ID="802038">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors apologize through gritted teeth.&lt;/b&gt; Pleased by their groveling, the thugs do not pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they will show them. Next time.</Text>
  <Text ID="802987">Snow Globe</Text>
  <Text ID="803026">&lt;b&gt;Sails frozen, food rotten, ship on the brink of breaking.&lt;/b&gt; It's a blizzard! All notion of time and direction has long been lost: a never-ending tempest of snow surrounds the ship, blurring the limits between night and day, sky and sea. Stalactites have imprisoned your sails, binding them to the masts and making them creak under the unexpected weight. Your crew fears they might break, but should anyone venture outside while violent winds whip the upper deck?</Text>
  <Text ID="802991">Climb the mast and detach the frozen sails</Text>
  <Text ID="802993">&lt;b&gt;The ship can safely withstand the blizzard.&lt;/b&gt; Several sailors of impressive builds climb your masts to unhook and detach the heavy sails, and despite the slippery wood and tightly frozen ropes, they manage to free the masts of the dangerous weight. The barren poles stand tall against the receding storm. Morning light soon pierces the clouds, a good omen to salute your crew's efforts and accompany their celebration.</Text>
  <Text ID="802994">&lt;b&gt;The task is far from easy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors have good strength and are used to climb the masts, but they lack either luck or skill when it comes to speed. Before they can reach the foremast, the fore sail breaks out of its bounds and flaps wildly against the weakened mast while the other sails continue to foster stalactites of increasing length and weight. The foremast emits a shrilling sound of protest.</Text>
  <Text ID="802996">Aim at the ties holding the rogue sail</Text>
  <Text ID="803011">&lt;b&gt;The rogue sail is taken down!&lt;/b&gt; Precise shots take out its ties without so much as scratching the foremast, and the sail is sent to disappear into the storm. The lack of the sail's furious whipping seems to be enough for the mast to hold its ground. When the blizzard recedes, your ship is lacking a sail but nothing more.</Text>
  <Text ID="803013">&lt;b&gt;Alas, your mast is not spared.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors shoot at the ties of the fore sail but the task is too meticulous for them: they shoot at the ropes, the poles, the mast itself. The raging sail is swallowed by the storm while the foremast collapses and crushes the starboard. In a final irony, the storm soon calms down and lets your crew calculate how their lack of meddling would have caused less damage.</Text>
  <Text ID="802997">Fire all guns and shake off the ice</Text>
  <Text ID="803014">&lt;b&gt;The stalactites are dealt with.&lt;/b&gt; In a bold act of defiance towards logic and prudence, your artillery men fire the cannons to send precisely gauged vibrations through your ship. The foremast protests but resists while the pikes of ice parasitising its sails break and rain on the deck in a cacophony of tingling sounds. Your maimed ship has but to wait for the blizzard to run out of breath now.</Text>
  <Text ID="803015">&lt;b&gt;Reckless, and proportionately paid.&lt;/b&gt;Gauging the difference between power which might break the stalactites only and power which might also break the mast is beyond the understanding of most humans, your artillery men included. The tremor of the cannons shakes the whole ship and provokes the crashing fall of its foremast. Ironically, the blizzard reacts by calming down and leaves the sailors to their broken ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802995">&lt;b&gt;Resounding failure.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors clearly don't have the ability to climb the masts, in this storm or in clear weather - how could they even be allowed on a ship? As they bicker over their deficiency, the main mast beckons their attention: its base is entirely frozen and the wood screams against the invading cold.</Text>
  <Text ID="803016">Strengthen the mast with chains and planks</Text>
  <Text ID="803020">&lt;b&gt;A straightforward if rough solution.&lt;/b&gt; Planks and poles are erected around the masts and bound by ropes and chains in the hope that the swaying barricade will prevent the masts from breaking. Despite its movement, the construction is sturdy and actually accompanies the masts as they move in the wind, giving them a welcome support. When the blizzard leaves, your ship is plucked naked but its masts still stand.</Text>
  <Text ID="803021">&lt;b&gt;The trigger of catastrophy.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors tie planks and poles around the masts, pulling chains around them as tightly as they can, oblivious to the carpentry laws ruling over the movement of towering objects. The masts try to break free of the man-made prisons and jump out of them, crashing onto the deck one after the other. As if chased by the hysteria below, the blizzard flees and lets sunrays fall on the barren carcass of your ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="803019">Boil seawater to gather ice-melting salt</Text>
  <Text ID="803022">&lt;b&gt;Somehow, it works.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors take the time to slowly distil seawater in order to avoid improper condensation. The salt is acquired faster than anticipated and spread over the base of the main mast, forcing the ice back to its liquid form. The blizzard keeps filling the sails until it goes out of breath and recedes, but the furious weather was enough to greatly maim the ship. There will be extensive repairs.</Text>
  <Text ID="803023">&lt;b&gt;There was no chance of success.&lt;/b&gt; To gather salt, your sailors keep away from the wind and bury inside the deck to lit a fire under a pot of seawater. Their condenser is poorly handled and causes the water to fall back into the pot - causing them to believe the fire isn't burning hard enough. They fan the flames. Hell rises. The blizzard is fed gusts of murky smoke and spits it back out before receding, revealing the half-burnt carcass of your ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802992">Stay inside and hope the supplies last</Text>
  <Text ID="803024">&lt;b&gt;Prudence and faith pay off.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huddle together in the lower deck, resisting the temptation to go check the masts and their frozen sails. Time trickles away as the storm recedes, and when the blizzard is no more than a light drizzle, the sun emerges to illuminate your ship. It's perfectly unscathed and slowly drifts towards the coast, where a harbour is already in sight.</Text>
  <Text ID="803025">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' feeble trust is not enough to fuel their patience.&lt;/b&gt; The storm lingers and with each new gust of raging wind the main mast complains and moans, until distinct sounds of breaking wood resonate through the ship. That's enough waiting! Several sailors rush to the upper deck in the hope of strengthening or defrosting the mast.</Text>
  <Text ID="800336">The Minefield</Text>
  <Text ID="800337">&lt;b&gt;At the cry of "mines!", all rush to the prow.&lt;/b&gt; Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. "Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?"   </Text>
  <Text ID="800338">Use dynamite to start a chain reaction</Text>
  <Text ID="800339">&lt;b&gt;"The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!"&lt;/b&gt; says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope. As the last motes of fire trail down into the waves and fizzle, the crew can but admire such brave use of dynamite. "Better than fireworks!" says another, "The men have never been so entertained!"</Text>
  <Text ID="800340">Try to navigate the minefield</Text>
  <Text ID="800341">&lt;b&gt;"We are masters of the sea!"&lt;/b&gt; sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. "Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!" Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!   </Text>
  <Text ID="800342">&lt;b&gt;"What was that noise?" gulps the helmsman,&lt;/b&gt; but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess. </Text>
  <Text ID="800343">&lt;b&gt;While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.&lt;/b&gt; A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. "With some makeshift device, we can clear the path ahead," explains the officer, "either that, or we just try our best to weave through it."</Text>
  <Text ID="800348">Build a device</Text>
  <Text ID="800349">&lt;b&gt;"She survived! It worked!" calls the lookout,&lt;/b&gt; as makeshift grapples trailing behind the little dinghy are able to hook the mines aside. Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. "How did we get in such a pickle?" says one. "At least we're out of it," says another.</Text>
  <Text ID="800350">&lt;b&gt;A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.&lt;/b&gt; The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800351">&lt;b&gt;The idea is a terrible one from the start.&lt;/b&gt; The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.</Text>
  <Text ID="802896">Try to weave through the minefield</Text>
  <Text ID="802897">&lt;b&gt;"What was that noise?" gulps the helmsman,&lt;/b&gt; but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess. </Text>
  <Text ID="802898">&lt;b&gt;The awfulness has barely begun.&lt;/b&gt; Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. "Brace!" scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="800344">&lt;b&gt;The awfulness has barely begun.&lt;/b&gt; Restless waves conceal a thickening of the mines, and the ship's haphazard path makes impact inevitable. "Brace!" scream port-side, just prior to a portion of men and timber being propelled violently upward. That no further detonations follow is of little relief to a crew who have lost many good sailors, and sustained such significant damage to their ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="800352">Go through diplomatic papers in search of any clues</Text>
  <Text ID="800353">&lt;b&gt;The search is a fruitful one.&lt;/b&gt; The well-organised diplomatic library includes a comprehensive folio of papers on nearby mine positions. This enables the navigators to chart a safe course through the waters. The very same paper remarks that the mines were moored during the war, in order to protect a now-disused outpost. You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.    </Text>
  <Text ID="800354">&lt;b&gt;The search is worthwhile.&lt;/b&gt; After a few hours scouring the diplomatic archives, a paper on nearby mine positions is found. This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.</Text>
  <Text ID="800355">&lt;b&gt;The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.&lt;/b&gt; A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="800356">&lt;b&gt;Optimism makes way for abject terror,&lt;/b&gt; as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. "Misinformation is worse than no information," an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.     </Text>
  <Text ID="800357">Turn around and try to escape</Text>
  <Text ID="800358">&lt;b&gt;A few saintly volunteers approach,&lt;/b&gt; offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply "The lord will see us through."</Text>
  <Text ID="800359">Allow them to go ahead</Text>
  <Text ID="800361">&lt;b&gt;The volunteers exude calm,&lt;/b&gt; as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text>
  <Text ID="800362">&lt;b&gt;While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,&lt;/b&gt; it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation. </Text>
  <Text ID="800363">&lt;b&gt;For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable&lt;/b&gt; the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. "The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days," says a devastated officer. </Text>
  <Text ID="800364">&lt;b&gt;It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew&lt;/b&gt; are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed firsthand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.</Text>
  <Text ID="800360">Tell them to stay on the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="800365">&lt;b&gt;Your faith goes untried&lt;/b&gt; in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.</Text>
  <Text ID="800366">&lt;b&gt;Your faith does not go untried.&lt;/b&gt; The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="800367">&lt;b&gt;None of it is of any use.&lt;/b&gt; Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe. </Text>
  <Text ID="800575">Lost in the Desert</Text>
  <Text ID="800576">&lt;b&gt;The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.&lt;/b&gt; The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.</Text>
  <Text ID="800577">Use a reflective object to signal help</Text>
  <Text ID="800581">&lt;b&gt;A local rider comes to the rescue.&lt;/b&gt; He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.</Text>
  <Text ID="800578">Navigate by the stars</Text>
  <Text ID="800582">&lt;b&gt;Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.&lt;/b&gt; Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.</Text>
  <Text ID="800583">&lt;b&gt;Something of a path appears&lt;/b&gt;, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.</Text>
  <Text ID="800586">Ask at the fort for help</Text>
  <Text ID="800588">&lt;b&gt;The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.&lt;/b&gt; He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. "You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead." Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.</Text>
  <Text ID="800589">&lt;b&gt;You lack the means to communicate.&lt;/b&gt; Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.</Text>
  <Text ID="800587">Ignore the fort and continue along the path</Text>
  <Text ID="800590">&lt;b&gt;It is a long and draining journey.&lt;/b&gt; Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.</Text>
  <Text ID="800584">&lt;b&gt;The "stars are fickle", say your officers by way of excuse.&lt;/b&gt; After traveling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.</Text>
  <Text ID="800585">&lt;b&gt;The stars utterly perplex your party.&lt;/b&gt; With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...</Text>
  <Text ID="800591">Follow the local wildlife</Text>
  <Text ID="800594">&lt;b&gt;Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.&lt;/b&gt; As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.</Text>
  <Text ID="800595">&lt;b&gt;A wild goose chase to desolation.&lt;/b&gt; Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.</Text>
  <Text ID="800592">Divine for Water</Text>
  <Text ID="800596">&lt;b&gt;Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.&lt;/b&gt; The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.</Text>
  <Text ID="800597">&lt;b&gt;A pretty price for divine mercy.&lt;/b&gt; The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.</Text>
  <Text ID="800593">Move bravely on</Text>
  <Text ID="800598">&lt;b&gt;The sun is unspeakably hot.&lt;/b&gt; As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="800579">Wait for a sign of the true path</Text>
  <Text ID="800599">&lt;b&gt;Star of wonder, star of light!&lt;/b&gt; Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a garden of eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.</Text>
  <Text ID="800600">&lt;b&gt;Are the gods testing you?&lt;/b&gt; You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.</Text>
  <Text ID="800601">&lt;b&gt;The omen is a ravaging howl.&lt;/b&gt; "Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. "A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked," say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.</Text>
  <Text ID="800580">Walk stubbornly in one direction</Text>
  <Text ID="800602">&lt;b&gt;You are extremely lucky to survive.&lt;/b&gt; The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.</Text>
  <Text ID="800603">&lt;b&gt;Your expedition boils.&lt;/b&gt; Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.</Text>
  <Text ID="801642">Scylla and Charybdis</Text>
  <Text ID="801643">&lt;b&gt;Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.&lt;/b&gt; Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fishes with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.</Text>
  <Text ID="801646">Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore</Text>
  <Text ID="801648">&lt;b&gt;Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.&lt;/b&gt; Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is a brief as it is intense and the crew rejoices, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.</Text>
  <Text ID="801649">&lt;b&gt;The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.&lt;/b&gt; The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.</Text>
  <Text ID="801651">Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank</Text>
  <Text ID="801653">&lt;b&gt;A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.&lt;/b&gt; The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.</Text>
  <Text ID="801654">&lt;b&gt;Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.&lt;/b&gt; The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.</Text>
  <Text ID="801652">Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="801655">&lt;b&gt;Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.&lt;/b&gt; All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.</Text>
  <Text ID="801656">&lt;b&gt;What did they expect, attacking nature itself?&lt;/b&gt; The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.</Text>
  <Text ID="801650">&lt;b&gt;Fear clouds the navigators' readings.&lt;/b&gt; Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is a wreck more than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.</Text>
  <Text ID="801647">Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in</Text>
  <Text ID="801657">&lt;b&gt;The sailors' fright gives them wings.&lt;/b&gt; The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky maneuvers that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.</Text>
  <Text ID="801658">&lt;b&gt;There's only so many disasters faith can prevent.&lt;/b&gt; When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.</Text>
  <Text ID="802115">The Volcano</Text>
  <Text ID="802116">&lt;b&gt;Tremors, ash rain, light during night: it's an eruption!&lt;/b&gt; The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.</Text>
  <Text ID="802117">Go back to the ship despite the darkness</Text>
  <Text ID="802119">&lt;b&gt;The ship is quickly found.&lt;/b&gt; The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed in flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.</Text>
  <Text ID="802120">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.&lt;/b&gt; Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat. Too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognize the path and never make it back to the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802118">Find shelter against the incoming lava</Text>
  <Text ID="802121">&lt;b&gt;Shelter!&lt;/b&gt; The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, remains of a colonialist power, and deems it a better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.</Text>
  <Text ID="802125">Pray for the chapel to hold</Text>
  <Text ID="802127">&lt;b&gt;The chapel miraculously stands its ground.&lt;/b&gt; Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nested on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.</Text>
  <Text ID="802128">&lt;b&gt;Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.&lt;/b&gt; The crew remembers old aves from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.</Text>
  <Text ID="802126">Dig trenches in the holy ground</Text>
  <Text ID="802129">&lt;b&gt;The trenches are dug with military efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time and the pits redirect the lava as it flows in. The sailors snuggle in the chapel while lava runs around them, illuminating the stained glass, and they rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.</Text>
  <Text ID="802130">&lt;b&gt;Too much pressure and too little grit.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so does the lava enters the sacred place and hugs the walls, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.</Text>
  <Text ID="802122">&lt;b&gt;Your crew is lost and perplexed.&lt;/b&gt; Your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every new burnt tree, and it seems that every uncovered path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.</Text>
  <Text ID="802131">Follow a random animal and trust its instincts</Text>
  <Text ID="802133">&lt;b&gt;All animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.&lt;/b&gt; Tracking down the herd of squealing, screeching, shrilling critters could be done with eyes closed and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die into the ruthless volcano fire.</Text>
  <Text ID="802134">&lt;b&gt;Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' despaired behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all preys, be they beast or human.</Text>
  <Text ID="802132">Pick a random path and trust your instincts</Text>
  <Text ID="802135">&lt;b&gt;Fear is the most reliable instinct.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-created shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle and hop on the ship with the molten tongues on their heels, and the ship departs with a slightly charred hull but a safe crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="802136">&lt;b&gt;Fear is a treacherous adviser.&lt;/b&gt; Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.</Text>
  <Text ID="802138">Selfless Deeds</Text>
  <Text ID="802139">&lt;b&gt;"They steal your children?"&lt;/b&gt; The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-eaten with the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.</Text>
  <Text ID="802140">Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat</Text>
  <Text ID="802144">&lt;b&gt;Your assault is swift and without a single casualty.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers oppose no resistance when their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout, a sweatshop with no other employees than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exulting parents: they give no rewards but smiles and tears, and your crew basks in this priceless payment.</Text>
  <Text ID="802141">Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text>
  <Text ID="802145">&lt;b&gt;Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.&lt;/b&gt; The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken out of the kidnappers' steamboat and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.</Text>
  <Text ID="802148">Attack the bandits before they reach the barn</Text>
  <Text ID="802150">&lt;b&gt;The bandits don't know what hit them.&lt;/b&gt; Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802152">Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children</Text>
  <Text ID="802154">&lt;b&gt;Sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.&lt;/b&gt; The crew shoots and skewers while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerges from the barn and attacks the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, help themselves to their supplies, and triumphantly returns to the coast.</Text>
  <Text ID="802155">&lt;b&gt;Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat without a chance to liberate more children. The flee to the village and share what information they can with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids but aware that many more are still captive.</Text>
  <Text ID="802153">Acknowledge the danger and leave with what children are already saved</Text>
  <Text ID="802156">&lt;b&gt;The decision to run is not a simple one.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be and retreat to the village with the few children they have saved. They share what information they can with the villagers - maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, more planning... As the ship leaves the crew focuses on the good they did, rather than the deeds they could have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="802151">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.&lt;/b&gt; Their choreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drive the opponents back not because of their strength but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.</Text>
  <Text ID="802157">Fight the brute</Text>
  <Text ID="802159">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.&lt;/b&gt; Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords and wild eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!</Text>
  <Text ID="802160">&lt;b&gt;The mastodon tramples your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; The rescuers lack resistance and they are wiped by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In a ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802158">Run away</Text>
  <Text ID="802161">&lt;b&gt;No sailor harmed, no child saved.&lt;/b&gt; The crew manages to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it pales when your rescue team comes back with no rescued child.</Text>
  <Text ID="802149">Hide between the tree and wait for nightfall</Text>
  <Text ID="802162">&lt;b&gt;The crew merges with the trees.&lt;/b&gt; Unseen, unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they do not hear your men approach.</Text>
  <Text ID="802164">Steal their clothes to disguise as bandits</Text>
  <Text ID="802166">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors in disguise orchestrate the children's escape.&lt;/b&gt; Dressed with the bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn turned sweat shop where children are forced to work. One by one they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies: when the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunitions. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.</Text>
  <Text ID="802167">&lt;b&gt;The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.&lt;/b&gt; When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts for intruders. They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="802165">Capture the men to use them as hostages</Text>
  <Text ID="802168">&lt;b&gt;A flawless action, from start to finish.&lt;/b&gt; After a swift capture of the naked bandits, the sailors advance and discover the camp's true nature: a children-powered sweatshop. It is soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who does not care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew against the promise that your sailors will never set foot here again. The rescuers come back with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.</Text>
  <Text ID="802169">&lt;b&gt;The naked men overpower your fighters.&lt;/b&gt; The element of surprise does not compensate the lacking strength of the crew, and they are easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip and send them back as is, rescuers unable to retrieve the children and humiliated in the process.</Text>
  <Text ID="802163">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.&lt;/b&gt; They argue about the best place to hide and end up lining behind what could be the thinnest trees of the forest, their racket and bulging shapes attracting the undivided attention of the kidnapers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders and laughs at the puny men.</Text>
  <Text ID="802170">Face the brute</Text>
  <Text ID="802172">&lt;b&gt;The crew is puny indeed, and it is butchered.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits' leader needs no help to fight your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast can't even determinate the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.</Text>
  <Text ID="802146">&lt;b&gt;The terrain is not one your crew is used to.&lt;/b&gt; They get stuck in the mangrove roots and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.</Text>
  <Text ID="802173">Bluff and pretend backup is on its way</Text>
  <Text ID="802176">&lt;b&gt;Your bluff works!&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, pressed by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and deliver the kids, still amazed by their performance but upset they could save so little.</Text>
  <Text ID="802177">&lt;b&gt;They do not buy your bluff.&lt;/b&gt; Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up. They don't. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="802174">Attempt to buy the children</Text>
  <Text ID="802178">The kidnappers smirk.</Text>
  <Text ID="802179">Okay</Text>
  <Text ID="802181">&lt;b&gt;A pricey but worthy trade.&lt;/b&gt; Trying to hide their distaste for treating children like goods, your sailors bring the kids onboard. They are in a state of shock but look physically sound.</Text>
  <Text ID="802183">The children are safe with you, punish their abductors</Text>
  <Text ID="802186">&lt;b&gt;Your retribution is ruthless.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers are still counting the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame and all bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew brings the kids back to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts driven by violent instincts.</Text>
  <Text ID="802187">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors are overpowered.&lt;/b&gt; The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much less men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. They could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired. The crew is sent back to the village with the kids, both looking equally dishevelled and aghast.</Text>
  <Text ID="802184">The children will be safer with their parents, let the kidnappers leave</Text>
  <Text ID="802188">&lt;b&gt;Pity to let the culprits escape so easily.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors bring the children back to their respective families, but the kids' joy fails to hide how many more could have been saved given an extra effort.</Text>
  <Text ID="802180">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802189">&lt;b&gt;You do not match the bandits' expectations.&lt;/b&gt; To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard and cut his thumb before throwing it into your raft: a lesson for the penniless. Your sailors withdraw to the village, convinced they made things worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="802175">Let them be and leave</Text>
  <Text ID="802190">&lt;b&gt;There's only so much your sailors can do.&lt;/b&gt; They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for the effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.</Text>
  <Text ID="802147">&lt;b&gt;Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.&lt;/b&gt; The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate and they lose the bandits. They stumble upon both less and more than what they expected: a pit filled with torn shoes and their torn makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.</Text>
  <Text ID="802142">Stay on your ship and deploy fire when the steamboat appears</Text>
  <Text ID="802191">&lt;b&gt;A masterful shot!&lt;/b&gt; Using one of your precious spiral-muzzled cannons, the crew fires a single shot which pierces straight through the steamboat's engines. The boat gradually stops puffing and drifts to your own ship, where sailors can pluck the bandits and three stolen children.</Text>
  <Text ID="802194">Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout</Text>
  <Text ID="802197">&lt;b&gt;Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into saying the truth.&lt;/b&gt; There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed by their presence before a single word is spoken. The revealed hideout is an easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly bring all children back to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.</Text>
  <Text ID="802198">&lt;b&gt;The intention is here, but not the result.&lt;/b&gt; The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters indeed, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats are nothing to them. Knowing that these men know where the rest of the children are held, your crew hands them to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.</Text>
  <Text ID="802196">Enough risks for today: return the children and be on your way</Text>
  <Text ID="802199">&lt;b&gt;Thoughts of the remaining captives follow your crew.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers are thrilled to have the handful of children returned to them and profusely thank their saviors, making their remorse worse with each new praise. The sailors are happy for them but know they could have done more.</Text>
  <Text ID="802192">&lt;b&gt;Poor use of your firepower.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors handling the cannons and the weapons themselves are equally important: not as well-oiled as the machinery, the crew fails to adjust the quantity of powder used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats in the bayou at full speed.</Text>
  <Text ID="802201">Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff</Text>
  <Text ID="802193">&lt;b&gt;Both bandits and captives are killed.&lt;/b&gt; The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush in the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.</Text>
  <Text ID="802143">Ignore the bandits and go on your way</Text>
  <Text ID="802200">&lt;b&gt;Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.&lt;/b&gt; Some men and women refuse to leave and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they'd lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.</Text>
  <Text ID="802228">The Deeper You Go</Text>
  <Text ID="802229">&lt;b&gt;Boulder-blocked entrance and booby-trapped corridor: typical Mayan temple.&lt;/b&gt; After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation to forget its deathly aspect. They know what is said of Mayan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.</Text>
  <Text ID="802230">Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps</Text>
  <Text ID="802232">&lt;b&gt;The obvious traps are easily evaded.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers, or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?</Text>
  <Text ID="802233">Cross the run-down bridge</Text>
  <Text ID="802234">&lt;b&gt;The trial is passed!&lt;/b&gt; As they swing their arms to keep their balance, your sailors hit ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.</Text>
  <Text ID="802235">&lt;b&gt;Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew is on its knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch save for their wounded pride and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.</Text>
  <Text ID="802236">Climb down the chasm</Text>
  <Text ID="802237">&lt;b&gt;The climb is child's play.&lt;/b&gt; Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mayan engineers' entrance and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.</Text>
  <Text ID="802238">&lt;b&gt;The effort is above the crew's strength.&lt;/b&gt; An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slips down the stone, and a soft thud welcomes her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!</Text>
  <Text ID="802239">Find a way among the snakes</Text>
  <Text ID="802241">&lt;b&gt;The sailors manage to flee.&lt;/b&gt; Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles do not notice the furtive crew as it tip toes past them and escapes through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside of the temple, stunned by their survival.</Text>
  <Text ID="802242">&lt;b&gt;They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors progress among the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements they do not see the mass of snakes backing away from them and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it is filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.</Text>
  <Text ID="802240">Scare the snakes away with torches</Text>
  <Text ID="802243">&lt;b&gt;The crew stands its ground as well as it can.&lt;/b&gt; The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from both sailors and prey. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel which leads them outside, empty-handed but safe.</Text>
  <Text ID="802244">&lt;b&gt;What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?&lt;/b&gt; Your crew flaps the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, and they cannot even make one step forward that a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="802245">&lt;b&gt;The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.&lt;/b&gt; Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit. Sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.</Text>
  <Text ID="802246">Look for a possible hidden mechanism</Text>
  <Text ID="802249">&lt;b&gt;The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.&lt;/b&gt; Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They immediately run away from the sand and the temple itself.</Text>
  <Text ID="802250">&lt;b&gt;If there is a mechanism, they do not find it.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="802248">Break a possibly weak wall</Text>
  <Text ID="802251">&lt;b&gt;The old wall caves in effortlessly.&lt;/b&gt; Following the sand-pouring cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be coming. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs then clears to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit and end up on the beach where they had left the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802252">&lt;b&gt;The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.&lt;/b&gt; Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them, forcing its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="802231">Create your own path and push the boulder away</Text>
  <Text ID="802253">&lt;b&gt;The boulder moves!&lt;/b&gt; The combined efforts of the crew manage to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back in place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="802255">Push against the wall to stop it</Text>
  <Text ID="802257">&lt;b&gt;The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.&lt;/b&gt; They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.</Text>
  <Text ID="802258">&lt;b&gt;The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.&lt;/b&gt; As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: scribbled letters in a language she can actually understand! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Crawling by day, airborne by night."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.</Text>
  <Text ID="802259">Press the sloth</Text>
  <Text ID="802263">&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; The brick above the pressed button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel and is expelled outside the temple.</Text>
  <Text ID="802260">Press the bat</Text>
  <Text ID="802264">&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt; As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is into the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, if a bit rough and a bit- She screams. As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge from the opened wall, forcing the sailors to retreat through their nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.</Text>
  <Text ID="802261">Press the butterfly</Text>
  <Text ID="802265">&lt;b&gt;Right answer!&lt;/b&gt; The sailor hits the butterfly button and jubilates as the trap wall stops advancing and bricks whirl into the floor to shape a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever had carved such needlessly complicated indications in their mother tongue.</Text>
  <Text ID="802262">Press the cockroach</Text>
  <Text ID="802266">&lt;b&gt;Wrong answer.&lt;/b&gt;As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smashes the insects with whatever object they have at hand and their horror gives them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.</Text>
  <Text ID="802256">Look for another way out</Text>
  <Text ID="802267">&lt;b&gt;The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets morning light in and reveals a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.</Text>
  <Text ID="802268">&lt;b&gt;The sailors do not find an exit.&lt;/b&gt; All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms over, ready to crush their bones, when it suddenly leans forward and pushes the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. They are alive, but the very sight of stone walls will scare them for years.</Text>
  <Text ID="802254">&lt;b&gt;The boulder doesn't move.&lt;/b&gt; Your explorers push and nudge and thrust but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.</Text>
  <Text ID="802470">The Storm</Text>
  <Text ID="802472">&lt;b&gt;This tempest is beyond anything you have ever faced.&lt;/b&gt; The smell of salt is everywhere. The freezing water pierces everyone. The winds and waves hit your ship with impossible violence, making the vessel groan and tremble with each new strike, the air so full of sea-spray one could drown in it. Is there anything mere humans could do in the face of such godlike wrath?</Text>
  <Text ID="802474">Pray that the usual method will work and reef the sails</Text>
  <Text ID="802478">&lt;b&gt;Trust in your habits pays.&lt;/b&gt; Years of executing the same maneuvers have ingrained them into your crew's instincts. The sailors reef sail after sail despite the poor visibility - they do not need sight, for they are guided by the invisible hand of practice. Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802481">Sail through the storm</Text>
  <Text ID="802483">&lt;b&gt;The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.&lt;/b&gt; The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and masterfully skirts the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.</Text>
  <Text ID="802484">&lt;b&gt;Waiting would have been a better option.&lt;/b&gt; If the force of training helped your crew while reefing the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly until the storm decides to calm down.</Text>
  <Text ID="802482">Wait for the storm to pass</Text>
  <Text ID="802543">&lt;b&gt;The storm passes.&lt;/b&gt; With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.</Text>
  <Text ID="802479">&lt;b&gt;What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?&lt;/b&gt; The sails trash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reef them. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured when lightning booms in the distance.</Text>
  <Text ID="802486">Order the crew to finish reefing the sails</Text>
  <Text ID="802488">&lt;b&gt;Just in time!&lt;/b&gt; The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.</Text>
  <Text ID="802489">&lt;b&gt;There's no courage in these cowards.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the emergency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat. You can beat them into life, or say your prayers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802490">Threaten to flog them</Text>
  <Text ID="802492">&lt;b&gt;The threat works.&lt;/b&gt; The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.</Text>
  <Text ID="802493">&lt;b&gt;The threat of punishment is weak and unwarranted.&lt;/b&gt; Distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants have no mastery over the crew. Your sailors are too busy saving their skins to mind orders, especially when given with so little conviction. Your ship is consumed by the tempest, chewed and ground and spat. Its skeletal remains drift from the storm, with what small crew have survived.</Text>
  <Text ID="802491">Pray the storm will end</Text>
  <Text ID="802496">&lt;b&gt;Your prayers are heard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"A thousand may fall at your side, &lt;br/&gt;Ten thousand at your right hand, &lt;br/&gt;But it will not come near you. &lt;br/&gt;You will only observe with your eyes &lt;br/&gt;And see the punishment of the wicked."&lt;br/&gt;As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.</Text>
  <Text ID="802497">&lt;b&gt;The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.&lt;/b&gt; Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at least sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is torn and mangled.</Text>
  <Text ID="802487">Maneuver with what sails you have left</Text>
  <Text ID="802498">&lt;b&gt;To safety!&lt;/b&gt; Maneuvering with half the sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways away from it. The boat leaps in the trough of waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering the most resistance it can offer - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="802499">&lt;b&gt;A close call.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating with so little sails proves more difficult than expected and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, sailed more than it sails, and it is lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers equal to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.</Text>
  <Text ID="802500">&lt;b&gt;Too slow.&lt;/b&gt; The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps to sailing in a bit of bad weather, but not to storms of this magnitude. Not to a ship with half its sails reefed and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the freed sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It hurls the ship into its midst, tears both sails and men from it, and spews the remains in calmer seas.</Text>
  <Text ID="802475">Frenzied measures for frenzied times: open all sails and ride the storm</Text>
  <Text ID="802501">&lt;b&gt;Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.&lt;/b&gt; In a display of utter complete control over the ship, they pull it to ride an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. What gale should have torn the sails apart fills them and makes the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.</Text>
  <Text ID="802502">&lt;b&gt;A move as wasteful as it was risky.&lt;/b&gt; Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' ability: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this and the whole crew will follow!</Text>
  <Text ID="802503">Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship</Text>
  <Text ID="802507">&lt;b&gt;A bold move!&lt;/b&gt; Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw again is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they can finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.</Text>
  <Text ID="802508">&lt;b&gt;A move too bold.&lt;/b&gt; Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew has: the iron cross is dropped as the ship rolls to the opposite side of the anchor's hawsehole and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank and tears planks and railings as it falls. The waves do the rest. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.</Text>
  <Text ID="802504">Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady</Text>
  <Text ID="802509">&lt;b&gt;Safe and sound.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the battering rain and navigating the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organize a human chain to store all upper decks goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull and unable to do anymore for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.</Text>
  <Text ID="802510">&lt;b&gt;Mayhem.&lt;/b&gt; Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, which roll away from them and swing through the deck as the ship continues to pitch, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="802476">Use the steam engines to carefully follow the trough of waves</Text>
  <Text ID="802511">&lt;b&gt;Slow and steady.&lt;/b&gt;Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers maintain your ship under favourable winds and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm shows no sign of relenting. </Text>
  <Text ID="802513">Overheat the engines to outrun the storm</Text>
  <Text ID="802515">&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text>
  <Text ID="802516">&lt;b&gt;You should have been more patient.&lt;/b&gt; The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at least the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.</Text>
  <Text ID="802514">Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off-tracks</Text>
  <Text ID="802544">&lt;b&gt;A negligible change of course.&lt;/b&gt; Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off for your safety.</Text>
  <Text ID="802512">&lt;b&gt;You would have been better off with a windjammer.&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast is unfastened!</Text>
  <Text ID="802521">Fasten the ballast back into place</Text>
  <Text ID="802523">&lt;b&gt;Your prayers are heard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"A thousand may fall at your side, &lt;br/&gt;Ten thousand at your right hand, &lt;br/&gt;But it will not come near you. &lt;br/&gt;You will only observe with your eyes &lt;br/&gt;And see the punishment of the wicked."&lt;br/&gt;As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.</Text>
  <Text ID="802524">&lt;b&gt;Too heavy, too dangerous.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place but the ship continues to pitch and their footing is unsteady and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them and your sailors are knocked down and crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.</Text>
  <Text ID="802522">Make use of the steamships sails to survive</Text>
  <Text ID="802525">&lt;b&gt;You run a pretty decent storm jib!&lt;/b&gt; Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the erratic movements, and strain the rudder this way and that. It is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their limit, and the sudden force breaks the ship out of its pitching. The navigators seize the opportunity to escape the storm to the delighted clamor of the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="802526">&lt;b&gt;Disaster.&lt;/b&gt; Proving once more how unable they are to navigate the ship, the navigators attempt what should never be attempted: go against the wind. As the ship twirls the transversal gale strikes it with full force, transforming the yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When it drains away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace left of the sailors taken by the storm.</Text>
  <Text ID="802477">Overwork the steam engines to boldly escape the storm</Text>
  <Text ID="802527">&lt;b&gt;A power stronger than the elements themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit, the screw propeller moving beyond what human sight can perceive and propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.</Text>
  <Text ID="802528">&lt;b&gt;The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.&lt;/b&gt; Assuming that the engines heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and bring the boiler way over its capacity. The temperature rises and the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engine explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.</Text>
  <Text ID="802529">Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer</Text>
  <Text ID="802531">&lt;b&gt;An unexpected turnaround.&lt;/b&gt; A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her as the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable if amateurish skill and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.</Text>
  <Text ID="802533">&lt;b&gt;From bad to worse.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.</Text>
  <Text ID="802534">Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer</Text>
  <Text ID="802537">&lt;b&gt;If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed closed, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace and his incessant sermon make the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.</Text>
  <Text ID="802538">&lt;b&gt;Hell indeed.&lt;/b&gt; Whether the volunteer lacked faith or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardely touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve cover his sceams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.</Text>
  <Text ID="802536">Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself</Text>
  <Text ID="802539">&lt;b&gt;The least bad of your worst.&lt;/b&gt; The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths as the crew ventilates the room by quickly opening and closing its door, avoiding the steam with damp armors of their own. The man manages to close the valve and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking and wait for the storm to end on its own.</Text>
  <Text ID="802540">&lt;b&gt;Don't you know when to stop?&lt;/b&gt; The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, where the steam contaminates the wet protection with insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, its outcry echoed by the tempest. The steam follows and burns all sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubborness of the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="802530">Shut off the engines and rely on your sails</Text>
  <Text ID="802541">&lt;b&gt;Audacious!&lt;/b&gt; Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all sails available on the ship. The sailors have may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels, and navigation is in their blood. The wind is faced and the waves ignored and the steering wheel locked into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural solution for a steam ship, but a good display of skill.</Text>
  <Text ID="802542">&lt;b&gt;Reckless!&lt;/b&gt; Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.</Text>
  <Text ID="802609">The Mountain Maw</Text>
  <Text ID="802610">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors face the mountain without a map.&lt;/b&gt; After a race from guide to guide through the depths of the mountain range, the crew finds itself devoid of chaperon: the guide supposed to take them on this last trip didn't show up at the agreed time. Forget what initial goal the exploration followed. Getting out of the snow-whipped peak is the only priority.</Text>
  <Text ID="802611">Traverse the mountain on your own</Text>
  <Text ID="802613">&lt;b&gt;Your navigators make do without a guide.&lt;/b&gt; They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a straight direction, staying put during the night despite the dwindling supplies. At long last they find a stream of melted snow and follow it downhill to the feet of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.</Text>
  <Text ID="802614">&lt;b&gt;A guide would have been helpful.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, which is not enough. The narrow roads disappear under the snow mist and they branch around the skeletal trees, spreading your crew across their ramifications. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.</Text>
  <Text ID="802618">Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow</Text>
  <Text ID="802620">&lt;b&gt;The feet of the mountain, at last.&lt;/b&gt; The crew progresses step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps and leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time but it helps avoiding any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, disgruntled to have been left behind despite the crew's efforts at guiding them, and they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, unable to express their relief.</Text>
  <Text ID="802621">&lt;b&gt;The explorers get more lost with each passing day.&lt;/b&gt; They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.</Text>
  <Text ID="802622">Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill</Text>
  <Text ID="802625">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the mountain's feet.&lt;/b&gt; The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors as they quell their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="802626">&lt;b&gt;Where did they come from? Where should they go?&lt;/b&gt; The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew is taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle, and like the streams not all of them find the feet of the mountain.</Text>
  <Text ID="802623">Force your way through the mounds of powder snow</Text>
  <Text ID="802627">&lt;b&gt;The sailors draw strength from their last resources.&lt;/b&gt; They ignore the colossal distance they have to cross and focus on small milestones instead. Two steps to that tree. Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle and reach the feet of the mountain. The crew stumbles and falls in relief when they realize they made it out alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="802628">&lt;b&gt;The sailors are too weakened by the cold.&lt;/b&gt; They dig through the powder snow which collapses on them without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.</Text>
  <Text ID="802624">Prioritise your supplies and look for food</Text>
  <Text ID="802629">&lt;b&gt;The crew extends its stay in the cold to gather supplies.&lt;/b&gt; Game is scarce and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The cooking fire's lights spreads through the forest at night and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoids talking about abandoning their companions and they leave the mountain in silence.</Text>
  <Text ID="802630">&lt;b&gt;Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.&lt;/b&gt; Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be the most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks under them and a handful of sailors dives into a deep fault.</Text>
  <Text ID="802619">Go back, and look for the missing sailors</Text>
  <Text ID="802631">&lt;b&gt;The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.&lt;/b&gt; The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: they have found a beaten path which leads straight to the feet of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.</Text>
  <Text ID="802632">&lt;b&gt;The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.&lt;/b&gt; A powdery white covers everything in sight and the skies melt into the ground, hiding the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct, unable to look for hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors by encountering their fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there, and two hunters joined them.</Text>
  <Text ID="802633">Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling</Text>
  <Text ID="802637">&lt;b&gt;The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.&lt;/b&gt; It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.</Text>
  <Text ID="802638">&lt;b&gt;The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.&lt;/b&gt; They launch ropes into the rift but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling and pulling and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The swallowed crew is never seen again.</Text>
  <Text ID="802634">Abandon them and continue downhill</Text>
  <Text ID="802639">&lt;b&gt;Salvation at the price of their humanity.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulates him for his selflessness, and they pretend the deed was enough to ease their conscience.</Text>
  <Text ID="802612">Go back on your tracks</Text>
  <Text ID="802640">&lt;b&gt;The path is easy to recognize, but it is tortuous and unforgiving.&lt;/b&gt; The crew fights against the elements, hurrying through the mountain passages lest their tracks disappear and leave them without hints to follow. When they finally escape the mountain range, they cannot remember how many nights they spent walking and how many days they spent starving.</Text>
  <Text ID="802642">Blood, Oil, Tears and Sweat</Text>
  <Text ID="802643">&lt;b&gt;An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.&lt;/b&gt; The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.</Text>
  <Text ID="802644">Release the stern anchor to the sea floor</Text>
  <Text ID="802646">&lt;b&gt;Safe.&lt;/b&gt; The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the sea floor. The ship wobbles, washed by the waves and winds, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.</Text>
  <Text ID="802647">&lt;b&gt;A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.&lt;/b&gt; The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor will not be of any help, the lieutenants order all to descend into the bottom of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.</Text>
  <Text ID="802648">Take the time to present this solution as the best</Text>
  <Text ID="802650">&lt;b&gt;The loss of time was necessary.&lt;/b&gt; Your lieutenants take the time to convince the merchants, detailing all available options one by one despite the increasingly high pressure from the waves and the rocking of the ship. Their stoicism more than their arguments convince the merchants of following orders, and they join the rest of the crew in the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.</Text>
  <Text ID="802651">&lt;b&gt;A loss of time.&lt;/b&gt;Pressed by the emergency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull and water seeps in their wake.</Text>
  <Text ID="802652">Repair the hole while the water is still pouring</Text>
  <Text ID="802654">&lt;b&gt;Your crew is used to repairs in poor conditions.&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep into the pouring water. Drenched supplies float and sink around them as they plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.</Text>
  <Text ID="802655">&lt;b&gt;Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.&lt;/b&gt; Overwhelmed by the current and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan of the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore, ripped apart. The repairs last for weeks.</Text>
  <Text ID="802653">Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level</Text>
  <Text ID="802656">&lt;b&gt;The forced instability protects the ship.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.</Text>
  <Text ID="802657">&lt;b&gt;A ludicrous plan.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to budge the ballast into place. The ship remains steady, allowing more and more water in and sinking with the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.</Text>
  <Text ID="802649">Drug them to avoid losing any more time</Text>
  <Text ID="802658">&lt;b&gt;Safe and drunk.&lt;/b&gt; The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck with the rest of the crew and what supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down and leaves the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.</Text>
  <Text ID="802659">&lt;b&gt;Too weak.&lt;/b&gt; The drinks your sailors offer to the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates in the ship: it came too close to shore, and the reefs pierced your hull! Water starts to pour in the lower decks.</Text>
  <Text ID="802645">Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water</Text>
  <Text ID="802660">&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor works as intended.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors quickly cable up a weighty assemblage and after fastening securely let it drop into the waves. It the water in its cloth, bobbing with the sea, pulling against the water to increase its drag. Your ship gains enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves and the crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.</Text>
  <Text ID="802661">&lt;b&gt;The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors tack together extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. Your merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!</Text>
  <Text ID="802662">Face the wave head on</Text>
  <Text ID="802665">&lt;b&gt;Fearless.&lt;/b&gt; Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manages to keep the ship straight and face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight prow cuts its fury in two and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focuses on the repairs and considers how exceptional their survival was.</Text>
  <Text ID="802666">&lt;b&gt;Too audacious.&lt;/b&gt; The gusts of wind fill your sails and the frantic currents pull your hull, and your crew is way too untrained to keep their reins over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass stays still, water and bodies flowing from its bent silhouette.</Text>
  <Text ID="802664">Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas</Text>
  <Text ID="802669">&lt;b&gt;The water's anger dies out!&lt;/b&gt; Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.</Text>
  <Text ID="802670">&lt;b&gt;Their greed overcomes your strength.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors try to reason, then to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew is weak in both body and spirit while the merchants have built their fortunes on hard-headedness. Long after the ship has been hit, crushed, and stranded, the merchants's cadavers are found lying on the shore's pebbles, still clutching their barrels of cargo.</Text>
  <Text ID="803304">Good Whale Hunting</Text>
  <Text ID="803305">&lt;b&gt;"The whales are still around us!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impossibly large trails of water break the wake of the ship, and the froth parts to reveal leathery dark skin. The whales are gaining speed, and impact is imminent.</Text>
  <Text ID="803306">Launch the steam ship at full speed.</Text>
  <Text ID="803307">&lt;b&gt;The wonders of technology!&lt;/b&gt; The steam engines roar above the whales' chant and the ship lunges away from the creatures in a cacophony of grating metal and whistling vapor. An investment well paid.</Text>
  <Text ID="803308">Maneuver the ship to avoid the whales.</Text>
  <Text ID="803309">&lt;b&gt;A masterful maneuver!&lt;/b&gt; The captain stirs the ship alongside the school of whales, and the animals glide past the boat in a slow and graceful ballet. The crew salutes their captain's skill and revel in the moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="803310">&lt;b&gt;Hard to avoid what you cannot see.&lt;/b&gt; The whales are everywhere: on the sides, in front, in the back, under the ship. The captain strains against the limits of his skill but cannot avoid the impacts coming from below, and part of the cargo is sent flying before the ship can escape.</Text>
  <Text ID="803311">&lt;b&gt;A school of whales is not a road you can simply navigate.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship shifts to the side, the closest whale reacts to the sudden movement by playing dead: it stops swimming and lets itself fall at an agonizingly slow speed. The impact with the rudder is brutal and bends the vital mechanism.</Text>
  <Text ID="803312">Attack! Harpoon the closest animal.</Text>
  <Text ID="803313">&lt;b&gt;A feat of strength for a gratuitous kill.&lt;/b&gt; The harpoon impales the leading whale and the rest of the school collides with its body, their advance brutally stopped. The ship leaves without a scratch.</Text>
  <Text ID="803314">&lt;b&gt;The harpoon strikes a calf, causing the school's attack.&lt;/b&gt; The wounded whale swirls to try and get rid of the iron rod and its elders surround it, pushing the ship away from their young. The boat dives on its side and several men fall overboard.</Text>
  <Text ID="803315">Throw a roped harpoon to save the drowning sailors.</Text>
  <Text ID="803316">&lt;b&gt;A harpoon is sacrificed to rescue the men.&lt;/b&gt; The men grab the harpoons's anchoring rope and climb back aboard, just in time to see the rope snap and fall into the abyss. The ship flees before any whale resurfaces.</Text>
  <Text ID="803317">&lt;b&gt;The rescuing harpoon triggers the whales' attack.&lt;/b&gt; The roped weapon could have made a good rescue device, but the cetaceans were already restless from the previous throw. A whale simply tilts its head up and a massive wave engulfs the drowning sailors, crashes against the ship, and rams it away from the begging and screaming men.</Text>
  <Text ID="803318">Get away from the flustered whales.</Text>
  <Text ID="803319">&lt;b&gt;The fate of the drowning men is sealed.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship gets away from the whales, the captain prays aloud for the sailors' survival. No one among the crew is naive enough to believe his words, but they all pretend.</Text>
  <Text ID="803320">Sing a military favorite to scare the whales away.</Text>
  <Text ID="803321">&lt;b&gt;The whales dance away from the ship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Eternal Father, strong to save,&lt;br/&gt;Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,&lt;br/&gt;Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,&lt;br/&gt;For those in peril on the sea!"&lt;br/&gt;In a unison born out of a common love of the hymn, the sailors sing and brace themselves for impact, only to realize the creatures have drifted away. A tale of dancing whales will be part of this expedition's story!</Text>
  <Text ID="803322">&lt;b&gt;The performance's efficiency is questionable.&lt;/b&gt; Trying their best to be in unison, the sailors shout their hearts out more than they sing, and the underwater creatures do not seem to care. Its group screaming occupies the crew for a long time, allowing the ship to drift closer to the school of whales.</Text>
  <Text ID="803323">&lt;b&gt;The crew ridicules itself.&lt;/b&gt; The underwater whales cannot hear the sounds squirming from the ship, and it's for the best. Dejected, their ears ringing, the sailors blame each other for the performance and the team's unity and pride are deeply dented. Getting squashed by a whale would have been a better option.</Text>
  <Text ID="803324">Send a man in the diving bell to fix the rudder.</Text>
  <Text ID="803325">&lt;b&gt;The sailor had rarely worked with such a view.&lt;/b&gt; As the hours disappear while he fixes the rudder, the whales continue their inexorable advance in a vision of lethargic yet grandiose movement. When the rudder is repaired, whales are still passing by, too close for comfort.</Text>
  <Text ID="803332">&lt;b&gt;The diving bell's rope tightens, then floats back up.&lt;/b&gt; Both equipment and sailor are lost to the unfathomable depths and their gigantic inhabitants, and the crew ponders whether the accident was caused by chance or animal malevolence.</Text>
  <Text ID="803335">Fire canons in the water to scare the whales away.</Text>
  <Text ID="803336">&lt;b&gt;The tiny cannonballs somehow drive the massive creatures away.&lt;/b&gt; As the sea foams and whitens because of the multiple impacts, it hides what reaction the whales may have. When the froth clears, the animals seem to have dived away from the ship but the men stay tense for a long while.</Text>
  <Text ID="803337">&lt;b&gt;Ten pounds cannonballs against creatures of a hundred tons?&lt;/b&gt; A whale slams into the ship, then another one, then another. The repetitive impacts make the crew believe the attacks are intentional, and they rally into begging prayers and whimpers. When the ocean's fury recedes, they are left to count the sailors thrown overboard.</Text>
  <Text ID="803338">Wait for the whales to leave</Text>
  <Text ID="803339">&lt;b&gt;The whales are not eager to leave.&lt;/b&gt; Used to being a predatorless presence, a whale shoves aside the obstacle in its way and the ship is sent rocking. The damages are extensives and will take days to fix. The creatures go on in indifference, reminding the crew of their meagerness.</Text>
  <Text ID="803333">Keep sailing straight ahead, at the risk of collision.</Text>
  <Text ID="803334">&lt;b&gt;Neither ship nor whale tries to avoid impact.&lt;/b&gt; Used to being a predatorless presence, the whale shoves aside the obstacle in its way and the ship is sent rocking. The creatures go on in indifference, reminding the crew of their meagerness.</Text>
  <Text ID="800312">An Opera in the Jungle</Text>
  <Text ID="800313">&lt;b&gt;"It's too narrow and shallow this far upriver!"&lt;/b&gt; warns the steersman. Escorting Mr. Cardinale to the site of his rainforest opera house now seems all the more preposterous! The great patron of the arts twizzles his moustache in frustration! Apart from braving the difficulty ahead, only traversing a nearby hill might reconnect the expedition with the upper river.</Text>
  <Text ID="800314">Use your gunboat to navigate the shallows</Text>
  <Text ID="800318">&lt;b&gt;The design of the gunboat is vital to your success.&lt;/b&gt; Being of moderate size, and yet possessing the manoeuvering capabilities of a much smaller ship, the gunboat is able to navigate the awkward river shallows with ease. Mr. Cardinale is delighted that you have delivered him to the site of his proposed Opera House, and promises to talk favourably of each and every man when he returns to civilisation. </Text>
  <Text ID="800315">Have the ship transported over the hill to rejoin the river further up</Text>
  <Text ID="800319">&lt;b&gt;"What a champion performance!" squeals Mr. Cardinale,&lt;/b&gt; from the comfort of his cushioned chair. The great ship seems to swim up and over the hill. The long timbers on which it rolls, and corkscrew winches at intervals up the slope work perfectly. "I shall put in a good word for you all at the club," promises Cardinale, as the ship splashes down safely on the other side. The men are immensely proud of the miracle they have performed.</Text>
  <Text ID="800320">&lt;b&gt;Getting a ship over a hill is mad, but it works.&lt;/b&gt; "Is this absolutely necessary?" muses Mr. Cardinale having watched the crew slip for a week in mud. But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.</Text>
  <Text ID="800321">&lt;b&gt;There simply aren't enough materials&lt;/b&gt; to conduct such an elaborate enterprise. The crew think with a few extra bits and bobs, dragging the ship up the hill might be possible. </Text>
  <Text ID="800323">Proceed uphill without materials, belief will guide us through</Text>
  <Text ID="800325">&lt;b&gt;The men have the conviction&lt;/b&gt; to safely hoist the ship up and over the hill. It is a fatiguing week, but belief in making the impossible possible possesses them. When the ship finally splashes into the water, Mr. Cardinale has barely a christian word of thanks for the crew. It has taken a long enough after all.</Text>
  <Text ID="800326">&lt;b&gt;It is all going so well,&lt;/b&gt; this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.</Text>
  <Text ID="800327">&lt;b&gt;"I think it's going to give way!"&lt;/b&gt; cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill. Men try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text>
  <Text ID="800324">Ask the locals gathered around the scene if they are able to help</Text>
  <Text ID="800328">&lt;b&gt;The locals are willing to provide help and materials.&lt;/b&gt; While it takes the crew time to incorporate the materials into their winch design, the locals are happy to wait. Good relations make the feat of hoisting a ship over a hill less painful than it might have been. The boat finally clatters down into the water of the upper river. All are most grateful to the locals, without whom none of this would have been possible.</Text>
  <Text ID="800329">&lt;b&gt;A few locals vaguely offer to help,&lt;/b&gt; but their lukewarm efforts do little to relieve the exhausted crew. The ridiculous hill-climb takes more than a week. When the ship finally slips into the water over the other side, not even Mr. Cardinale has energy enough to care.</Text>
  <Text ID="800330">&lt;b&gt;The locals have absolutely no interest in helping you,&lt;/b&gt; and fade into the trees. Beleaguered by shouts from Mr. Cardinale, the men meekly follow orders. The mad persistence has disastrous consequences. The ship plummets back down the hill! Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. The hideous accident signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text>
  <Text ID="800322">&lt;b&gt;"I think it's going to give way!" cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale.&lt;/b&gt; The feet of your men slip and slide on the mudstrewn slope, as the great weight of the ship plummets it back down the hill. Many try to get out of the way, but are crushed beneath the keel. A hideous accident caused by inadequate materials, that signals the end of Cardinale's operatic ambitions.</Text>
  <Text ID="800316">Attempt to carefully navigate the narrow passage</Text>
  <Text ID="800331">&lt;b&gt;Competent navigation&lt;/b&gt; rescues your ship from the mother of all rivers. Mr. Cardinale is tremulous throughout, believing his dreams may beach like a river dolphin at any time. But over the course of three tricky days, information is relayed quickly enough between wheel and forecastle to avoid any harmful collisions. There is relief all around when the corner is made and the river broadens again.</Text>
  <Text ID="800332">&lt;b&gt;"Rapids?!" exhales Mr. Cardinale crossly.&lt;/b&gt; Ahead white water churns. There is nothing for it but to push on. As the ship strains against the current, there are dreadful noises from rocks on the keel. The crew wince at each and every thump and screech. Finally, after a week, the river broadens again, and the crew can inspect the damage - it doesn't look good.</Text>
  <Text ID="800333">&lt;b&gt;It is a heartbreaking experience.&lt;/b&gt; Days go by in the effort to lever the ship out of the sandy shallows, where it does not belong. It is battered by rocks and rapids, and leaks like a rusted bucket. Mr. Cardinale kicks up and awful fuss. Finally when it feels like progress is being made, the next bend reveals a harrowing sight - an insurmountable waterfall! Never have the crew felt more hopeless.</Text>
  <Text ID="800317">Decline to proceed any further and return to sea</Text>
  <Text ID="800334">&lt;b&gt;Mr. Cardinale is incensed&lt;/b&gt; that his grand plans for the rainforest Opera House have been thwarted. Some of the men find his blustering funny, but the officers are horrified that such an influential figure has been rebuffed, and are afraid to show their faces in society ever again.</Text>
  <Text ID="800932">The Icy Blizzard</Text>
  <Text ID="800933">&lt;b&gt;Trapped in the snow!&lt;/b&gt; When the furious blizzard relents, the exploration party see the mountain pass ahead is blocked. Some say the rough terrain can be crossed, others that they saw a small fork back along.</Text>
  <Text ID="800934">Blow up the freeze ahead</Text>
  <Text ID="800938">&lt;b&gt;The crew feel happy awe&lt;/b&gt;, at the resulting avalanche. There, as the pass beyond is revealed, they swear they see something lurching away. Giant and hirsute, it leaves no print but in the imagination.         </Text>
  <Text ID="800935">Craft something to traverse the terrain</Text>
  <Text ID="800939">&lt;b&gt;The skis are highly effective.&lt;/b&gt; Simply fashioned, and with a clever coating of paraffin. Some prove expert skiers, glissading with a flourish to the finish line, but all make it to the bottom. The whole thing has turned out to be a good bit of fun.</Text>
  <Text ID="800947">&lt;b&gt;Toboggans are better where it's flat.&lt;/b&gt; Though solidly made, the going is fast. One sled veers into a ravine. A cry below, "officer injured", but the wind is picking up.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800949">Descend and help the officer</Text>
  <Text ID="800952">&lt;b&gt;The doctor works quickly.&lt;/b&gt; Just what is needed with another blizzard brewing. "Temporary strapping," he says, "but should get us home." The officer, and rest of the party make shelter with little time left to spare.</Text>
  <Text ID="800953">&lt;b&gt;The doctor knows nothing of urgency.&lt;/b&gt; "Give my patient space!" he snaps at those trying to move things along. Meanwhile, a blizzard sweeps the ravine, and the onset of frostbite is enough to split the party. Neither the doctor nor his unfortunate patient are to be seen again. </Text>
  <Text ID="800951">Hope they manage alone</Text>
  <Text ID="800954">&lt;b&gt;You knew deep down not all would make it.&lt;/b&gt; "They're all returned but the injured fellow," comes the news. "There was no saving him, the way he was. Ice stripped the meat from his bones like a chef's mandorre."</Text>
  <Text ID="800948">&lt;b&gt;The clumsy snowshoes fail you.&lt;/b&gt; Whether it is in their design or construction, every step sinks the party deeper. The cold will claim lives before the storm is weathered.</Text>
  <Text ID="800936">Take the fork you passed</Text>
  <Text ID="800943">&lt;b&gt;It is not much of a detour.&lt;/b&gt; The going is steady and before long the warm fire of the base camp appears in view. The blizzard is something to tell the grandchildren, provided frostbite hasn't seen to that...</Text>
  <Text ID="800944">&lt;b&gt;The path is both steep and perilous.&lt;/b&gt; A narrow ledge along a sheer cliff lies ahead. Some men are ready to give up. All the while a strange noise keens below the gnashing gale. </Text>
  <Text ID="800955">Follow the divine voice</Text>
  <Text ID="800957">&lt;b&gt;A heavenly, enlightened voice calls.&lt;/b&gt; None stop to look down, so enchanted are they. Over a verge, appears a shrine with a great bell - the source of the sound - and beyond, a  pilgrims' path to the foot of the mountain.</Text>
  <Text ID="800958">&lt;b&gt;A non-believer falls to his death.&lt;/b&gt; "Those lacking conviction shall be tried and judged in this place," echoes the priest. The rest edge to safety, consoled by the apparent goodness in their hearts.</Text>
  <Text ID="800960">&lt;b&gt;Nothing but a demonic howl.&lt;/b&gt; The blizzard rises anew. Without hope to keep them aloft, it is no surprise when a ledge gives way, damning to hell below.</Text>
  <Text ID="800956">Urge your party to face their fears</Text>
  <Text ID="800961">&lt;b&gt;A song of solidarity rises through the line of snow-crusted faces.&lt;/b&gt; Clinging to what they most cherish, they edge to safety. Had they not been reminded of such incentives, it is doubtful they would have survived.   </Text>
  <Text ID="800962">&lt;b&gt;Only some take strength.&lt;/b&gt; The rest remain in a frozen huddle. They may have lacked courage to negotiate the high ledge, but will welcome in their icy death with creditable stoicism. </Text>
  <Text ID="800945">&lt;b&gt;A far more treacherous path&lt;/b&gt;, but your crew are committed now. A steep cliff ahead must be negotiated, and your ropes are too short.</Text>
  <Text ID="800965">Craft longer ropes and swing down</Text>
  <Text ID="800966">&lt;b&gt;All are saved, at a cost.&lt;/b&gt; Putting the ropes together is quite a task with frozen fingers. That the party are able to cling to the rope as they descend is a small miracle. Nevertheless, frostbite will do lasting damage to their digits.</Text>
  <Text ID="800967">&lt;b&gt;A small but critical detail is overlooked.&lt;/b&gt; Grip. A man falls from the top of the rope with a cry, tumbling those below him into the abyss like meat from a skewer. Only a few frozen grimaces survive.</Text>
  <Text ID="800964">Free climb</Text>
  <Text ID="800968">&lt;b&gt;It is a risky business.&lt;/b&gt; Though the cliff isn't lacking in handholds, this is a test of individual endurance. Some were never going to be up to it. As they fall, the will to survive in the others strengthens. </Text>
  <Text ID="800937">Await help</Text>
  <Text ID="800946">&lt;b&gt;Shelter is minimal.&lt;/b&gt; Huddling cannot keep out the cold. When a rescue party arrives with equipment the next morning, they find men frostbitten and hypothermic. Not all of them will survive the journey down.</Text>
  <Text ID="801063">The Arid Basin</Text>
  <Text ID="801064">&lt;b&gt;Water has dribbled almost to nothing during an inland survey&lt;/b&gt;, en route to the rendezvous. But hope springs eternal! A muddy river strikes through the arid basin. The crew are delirious when they realise it is not completely dried-up. Do you stop for water, or press on?  </Text>
  <Text ID="801065">Trust the Botanist's expertise</Text>
  <Text ID="801069">&lt;b&gt;The botanist foams at the mouth with thirst-quenching theories.&lt;/b&gt; "The best idea may be these trees. Cut them just here, and catch the drip of water beneath," they say, as they take a knife to the bark. Before an hour has passed, there's enough water to soothe a beached humpback.</Text>
  <Text ID="801066">Fashion a device to extract water from mud</Text>
  <Text ID="801070">&lt;b&gt;"The secret is boiling the water"&lt;/b&gt;, says one resourceful survivalist, "and needless to say a mixture of charcoal, sand and cloth makes a fine filter." With water drawn, filtered and boiled, the crew can be sure it is safe to drink. Time even for a mud bath - your safari brigade slopping about like happy hippo.</Text>
  <Text ID="801071">&lt;b&gt;The water still has a mighty pong&lt;/b&gt;, despite all solids having been separated out by the rudimentary device. Several feel terribly ill after drinking. A treatment can be improvised, or the survey can try to hold out until the rendezvous.</Text>
  <Text ID="801077">Improvise a treatment</Text>
  <Text ID="801079">&lt;b&gt;The sickness clears over time.&lt;/b&gt; "With dysentery the patient must rest," the sensible doctor said, "away from the others." With the last of the good water, and gentle nursing, the caravan reaches the rendezvous in fair health.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801080">&lt;b&gt;No-one is ready for dysentery.&lt;/b&gt; The sick are empty and weak, no fluids to replenish all they have lost. With only vague measures in place to prevent the spread, savannah delirium reigns. The survey never reaches the rendezvous.</Text>
  <Text ID="801078">Hurry to the rendezvous</Text>
  <Text ID="801081">&lt;b&gt;Haste saves some, but not all.&lt;/b&gt; Dysentery is thoroughly set in by the time the survey makes the rendezvous. Although the camp provides the sick every comfort, for many the rigours of the sickness prove too much. </Text>
  <Text ID="801072">&lt;b&gt;Hours under hot sun, for fatally little.&lt;/b&gt; Countless designs in the soil, and no prototype. When something is finally cobbles together, the fools test their stupid sieve with the last of the clean supply. It will be a miracle now if anyone survives.</Text>
  <Text ID="801067">Look for the source of the river</Text>
  <Text ID="801073">&lt;b&gt;Finding a river source is easy&lt;/b&gt;, but turning it into a shortcut? That takes brains. High above the dry basin, water piles blissfully into the gully. The men wouldn't miss a swim beneath a waterfall for the world!</Text>
  <Text ID="801074">&lt;b&gt;There's water, if you can get to it.&lt;/b&gt; Hippos are gathered all along the bank. This is their territory. If you don't refill here, there's no guarantee you'll find water further on. </Text>
  <Text ID="801082">Scare the hippos away</Text>
  <Text ID="801087">&lt;b&gt;Hip-hip hooray!&lt;/b&gt; The hippos run as fast as their stout legs will carry them. The serenity of the river bank is utterly destroyed, but none of your crew care, as they help themselves to bucketfuls of clean and highly quaffable drinking water. </Text>
  <Text ID="801083">Approach the water cautiously</Text>
  <Text ID="801088">&lt;b&gt;Someone knows their hippopotami.&lt;/b&gt; A kinship with the animals allows the gentle river bank to be shared. Fresh water is relayed by the bucket. A few nervous moments as a large female rears out of the water, but she just wants a bird to pick her teeth. Satisfied, the crew resume their trek to the rendezvous. </Text>
  <Text ID="801089">&lt;b&gt;There's movement in the hippo camp&lt;/b&gt;, as the crew approach, followed by violent evacuations of their gigantic nostrils. Mandolin jaws open wide in display, and it is pretty clear to the crew they have no choice but to back off. </Text>
  <Text ID="801090">&lt;b&gt;A game of unhappy hippos ensues!&lt;/b&gt; The water swirls with their pudgy bodies. They snort and scream, and prepare to charge.</Text>
  <Text ID="801091">Fire at the charging hippo</Text>
  <Text ID="801093">&lt;b&gt;Cold, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; The brigade focus fire at the closest Hippo, and soon it is dead. The other Hippo falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink. </Text>
  <Text ID="801094">&lt;b&gt;The Hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.&lt;/b&gt; One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks. There's almost no-one left to make the rendezvous.</Text>
  <Text ID="801092">Immediately run away and leave the area entirely</Text>
  <Text ID="801095">&lt;b&gt;Escape is more panic than anything else&lt;/b&gt;, but the crew are spooked. Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again. </Text>
  <Text ID="801084">Shoot at the Hippos</Text>
  <Text ID="801096">&lt;b&gt;Aquatic combat is a key discipline.&lt;/b&gt; What small guilt the crew feel about driving the poor hippos from their patch is overcome by a will to survive. Out here, it is such ruthlessness that separates the living from the dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="801097">&lt;b&gt;What shot hits, barely passes through blubber.&lt;/b&gt; The whole bloat of hippos charge, leaving them an instant to make a decision.   </Text>
  <Text ID="801098">Fire at the Hippos</Text>
  <Text ID="801100">&lt;b&gt;Cold, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; The brigade focus fire at the closest Hippo, and soon it is dead. The other Hippo falter, bellowed howls of grief echoing around the basin. As the blood of the majestic animal suffuses with the river, your crew must now find the audacity to drink. </Text>
  <Text ID="801101">&lt;b&gt;The Hippos bowl into your nine-pin soldiers.&lt;/b&gt; One is dead on impact. Others die slow, trampled or drowning, matchstick guns floating downriver like poohsticks. There's almost no-one left to make the rendezvous.</Text>
  <Text ID="801099">Run</Text>
  <Text ID="801102">&lt;b&gt;Escape is more panic than anything else&lt;/b&gt;, but the crew are spooked. Lurching through the water with hippos at their backs is not something they are lining up to try again.</Text>
  <Text ID="801085">Wait for nightfall, hoping they leave</Text>
  <Text ID="801103">&lt;b&gt;Hardly seems worth waiting for.&lt;/b&gt; The hippos wallow all evening, leaving only as night falls to graze. The crew have lost half a day's march on the rendezvous, for a bit of muddy water. </Text>
  <Text ID="801104">&lt;b&gt;A waste of time.&lt;/b&gt; The hippos leave at dusk to graze. Unfortunately, their patch is just a stone's throw away. Their aqueous eyes can be seen glistening in the moonlight, and no one wants to risk it.</Text>
  <Text ID="801075">&lt;b&gt;Following a river should have been easy.&lt;/b&gt; But your party are so focused on distant goals, they fail to look immediately ahead. Suddenly, a man shoots downward as if yanked by giant hands. There are holes everywhere! An underground system of caves, and tomb for your unlucky crew. </Text>
  <Text ID="801068">Press on to the rendezvous</Text>
  <Text ID="801076">&lt;b&gt;There was never enough water for all of them.&lt;/b&gt; A freak mist has the crew licking air with cracked tongues, but nothing can keep the wolf from the door. Several drop dead as old bone, before the safari staggers to the rendezvous camp.</Text>
  <Text ID="801587">Sunken Depths</Text>
  <Text ID="801588">&lt;b&gt;Unusual debris float among the waves.&lt;/b&gt; Mold-ridden planks of wood, strings of cloth, fragments of broken plaster, all tinted by the gray shade of time. Filled with childish excitation, the crew discusses the possibility of going underwater to uncover the debris' origin.</Text>
  <Text ID="801589">Send your diver into the depths</Text>
  <Text ID="801592">&lt;b&gt;The diver plunges into the ocean with fish-like ease.&lt;/b&gt; He follows the trail of debris through the murky waters and almost smacks into a wall of indescribable height. Unsure whether the obstacle is natural or man-made, the diver wanders along its smooth facade until he finds an uncanny artifact and resurfaces with it. His account of the underwater mystery fascinates the crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="801590">Improvise a diving bell</Text>
  <Text ID="801593">&lt;b&gt;The diving bell looks decent and feels solid.&lt;/b&gt; Two men climb aboard and the bell plunges into the depths while a whole group of sailors pumps air into its ventilation tube. The bell descends until it is stopped by a surface of coral. Underneath the colorful shapes, the sailors notice a silver coin on their left and a gaping, perfectly circular hole on their right.</Text>
  <Text ID="801595">Hope that it will resist the dive and push the bell into the hole</Text>
  <Text ID="801597">&lt;b&gt;Their trust in the work of their comrades pays.&lt;/b&gt; The bell slithers in a slow fall which allows the bewitched divers to take in the view. This is no sunken ship: the engraved hole was a window among a hundred more lining a hall of ridiculous proportions. A single ray of light, pouring from the hole, accompanies the bell's descent until it lands on what might have been statue alcoves. A shining green pearl lies in the lowest part of the alcove.</Text>
  <Text ID="801599">Ignore the pearl and risk the dive into darkness</Text>
  <Text ID="801601">&lt;b&gt;Call it luck or miracle, but the bell holds.&lt;/b&gt; One of the men lights the bell's lamp and the other dives, following the glow as it illuminates the silent scene below: ghostly statues of hunting scenes, collapsed frescoes depicting plentiful gardens, and a massive throne of fractured marble on which a sword waits, covered in fluttering kelp. When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.</Text>
  <Text ID="801602">&lt;b&gt;Lady Luck does not smile for the faithless.&lt;/b&gt; As the bell descends into the dark, so does the pressure rise and press against the makeshift protection. The sailors pull the signal rope in a panic, but despite their fervent prayers, they are not pulled up in time. All that the crew manages to retrieve from the sea are the broken bell and its broken contents.</Text>
  <Text ID="801600">Retrieve the pearl from the dead-end and resurface</Text>
  <Text ID="801603">&lt;b&gt;The pearl is made of pure jade!&lt;/b&gt; The crew marvels at it and all want to touch it, feel it, smell it. The pearl spreads a nostalgic fragrance of salt water, fresh moss and damp stones, and the sailors agree this might be the very smell of adventure.</Text>
  <Text ID="801598">&lt;b&gt;The bell doesn't resist the fall.&lt;/b&gt; Instead of gliding along the sides of the hole, the bell tilts, letting the water in. The men call for help and the crew immediately tries to pull them up, fighting against what rocks snare the bell, doing their best to save their mates, and unable to react when the rope snaps into their hands. They are left to mourn their sea-buried companions.</Text>
  <Text ID="801596">Pick up the coin and resurface</Text>
  <Text ID="801604">&lt;b&gt;Low risk, low reward.&lt;/b&gt; The diving bell emerges without a scratch and the crew enjoys the tiny silver coin, passing it around and commenting on its singular aspect. Their excitement can only survive for so long and the coin is stored in the officers' coffers while the sailors whisper what ifs leading to grander treasures.</Text>
  <Text ID="801594">&lt;b&gt;The homemade diving bell falls apart.&lt;/b&gt; The engineers, specialized in complex ship machinery, have no idea on how to make such a simple device. Their machine departs with two men onboard, and they continue to dive while the bell itself stays afloat. When the divers emerge, the engineers take an earful and the crew is too disheartened to make a new attempt.</Text>
  <Text ID="801591">Ignore the beckoning junk</Text>
  <Text ID="801605">&lt;b&gt;The sailors protest but understand the risk.&lt;/b&gt; As the ship goes on its way, its wake drowns the singular ruins and their promise of adventure.</Text>
  <Text ID="802000">A Crack in the Hull</Text>
  <Text ID="802002">&lt;b&gt;Water in the hull!&lt;/b&gt; The overloaded ship could only go so far with this many supplies in its belly: a series of strong waves sends the crates churning and the boat's stomach soon explodes. Cracks pierce the hull where the cargo hit it, and trickles of water pop one after the other in the storage space.</Text>
  <Text ID="802003">Use the electric water pump to allow proper repairs</Text>
  <Text ID="802006">&lt;b&gt;Specific solutions for specific situations: your preparation was on point.&lt;/b&gt; The electric pump roars and swallows water much faster that it can infiltrate the ship, allowing the sailors to repair the damage with ease.</Text>
  <Text ID="802004">Improvise a water pump to allow immediate repairs</Text>
  <Text ID="802007">&lt;b&gt;Your crew's craftiness has a solution for everything.&lt;/b&gt; Using communication tubes as the pump's body and spare metal sheets as paddles, the sailors manage to assemble what could pass for a proper water pump. A good dozen of men is needed to make it work, but they buy enough time for proper repairs.</Text>
  <Text ID="802008">&lt;b&gt;This joke of a pump looks like it came from the Dark Ages.&lt;/b&gt; As the sailors battle to have their own idea of a pump prevail over the others, they assemble a monster that does nothing more than blow bubbles. One of the cracks bursts in a spray of water that silences the machine and starts flooding the hull.</Text>
  <Text ID="802016">Throw supplies overboard to try and bring the crack over the waterline</Text>
  <Text ID="802010">Seal the overflowing section, regardless of what or who might still be inside</Text>
  <Text ID="802011">Make a decision, who knows what happens if you don't!</Text>
  <Text ID="802017">Okay</Text>
  <Text ID="802012">&lt;b&gt;The ship rises over the water, but at what cost?&lt;/b&gt; Sailors watch their supplies drift away from the vessel, their hearts lingering after the lost items until the officers remind them of the emergency of repairs.</Text>
  <Text ID="802018">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="802013">&lt;b&gt;There's nothing to be done.&lt;/b&gt; The ship slowly sinks, pulled into the water with each new fracture in its hull. Cargo and crew are washed by the leakage and the ship vomits their remains when it crashes on the shore. The survivors contemplate the wreckage in despair before trying to put the ship back in shape.</Text>
  <Text ID="802014">&lt;b&gt;Cargo and crew are set to drown in the leakage.&lt;/b&gt; The sailors close the hull's doors on their comrades, hushing their screams. However, there is no avoiding reopening the hull when time comes for repairs: the water flows out, carrying bodies transfixed in expressions of suffocation, terror, and betrayal.</Text>
  <Text ID="802005">Seal the damaged section and repair it at the next harbour</Text>
  <Text ID="802015">&lt;b&gt;The drown cargo cannot be salvaged.&lt;/b&gt; When the ship finally finds a harbour, its hull is so low under the waterline your crew fears the boat will sink. Although such fears are unfounded, the leakage drowned a good part of their stored food, and the repairs feel like they should have be done much earlier.</Text>
  <Text ID="800503">The Singular Case of the Midshipman</Text>
  <Text ID="800504">&lt;b&gt;The Midshipman is found with his throat slit, knife in hand.&lt;/b&gt; It would appear to be suicide, but appearances often prove deceptive. Understandably, the whole crew crowd the scene, debating whether he was the type to take his own life, or if someone might have gained by his passing. Needless to say, they expect some action be taken...</Text>
  <Text ID="800506">The Expert will have the answers</Text>
  <Text ID="800509">&lt;b&gt;There are gasps of macabre delight,&lt;/b&gt; as the famous detective reveals the only possible solution. "Elementary you see. Look at this tiny moth wing on the body. Moths are drawn to light, and the sole light this night past issued from... this man's LANTERN!!" The detective lunges across the deck and secures the watchman, who being as impressed with the deduction as everyone else, readily admits to having sought to gain rank by the murder.</Text>
  <Text ID="800507">Commence an investigation</Text>
  <Text ID="800510">&lt;b&gt;Careful analysis of the scene&lt;/b&gt; reveals two leads. Some believe an autopsy would leave the facts of the case plain, while others reckon the little time available should be spent analysing any evidence at the scene that might establish whodunnit.</Text>
  <Text ID="800512">Conduct an autopsy of the body</Text>
  <Text ID="800514">&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is conducted very capably,&lt;/b&gt; and confirms the midshipman took his own life. A severe tumour is also discovered on the midshipman's brain. A letter, found later, serves to explain that the fellow knew he hadn't long to live, and wished to face death in his own way. The crew are galvanised on hearing this story of bravery.</Text>
  <Text ID="800515">&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is sufficient to confirm it was murder.&lt;/b&gt; Strangulation was the cause of death, not a slit throat - which was added post-mortem. All else remains unknown. Nevertheless, with the cause of death established, the list of suspects is narrowed down to just a few who had the means and the motive for the crime.</Text>
  <Text ID="800517">Interrogate until someone confesses</Text>
  <Text ID="800519">&lt;b&gt;You out the grim truth.&lt;/b&gt; The alibi of one sailor does not match his fellows, and he cracks, confessing to the midshipman's murder. It transpires the midshipman had bragged of bedding the other man's wife. The murderer expresses only remorse for his crime, and as the noose is placed around his neck, the crew regret that justice must be so severe.</Text>
  <Text ID="800520">&lt;b&gt;The interrogation is painfully haphazard.&lt;/b&gt; Though it is clear one of the suspects must be the killer, lines of inquiry fail to produce answers. No option remains but to offload all the suspects at the next port to prevent further incident. It is a source of great shame to the crew that fine innocent sailors are certain to be among them.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800518">Beat out a confession</Text>
  <Text ID="800521">&lt;b&gt;A brutal approach, but one delivering quick results.&lt;/b&gt; It seems the midshipman was preparing to whistle-blow unauthorised smuggling below deck, and was killed for it. The ringleaders threatened others with a similar fate if they didn't keep quiet. The culprits are unceremoniously shot, and the vulgar matter is over.</Text>
  <Text ID="800522">&lt;b&gt;Torture seldom results in happiness.&lt;/b&gt; Your victim screams a confession, perhaps in the hope it will end the pain. With nothing else to go on, you scapegoat the poor beggar, and he is keelhauled until dead. The crew are in no doubt that this was the wrong man, and hope to escape your inhuman expedition at the first opportunity.</Text>
  <Text ID="800516">&lt;b&gt;The autopsy is dreadfully clumsy,&lt;/b&gt; and leaves the body almost unrecognisable. The unschooled "medic" evidently have a point to prove, and insist on defiling it further, despite being a bundle of nerves. By the end the morgue looks like a butchery, and the stricken mortician runs wildly about the ship, scalpel in hand. Several are injured trying to restrain him, but the psychological trauma of an unsolved mystery is twice as damaging.</Text>
  <Text ID="800513">Fashion a tool for gathering forensic evidence</Text>
  <Text ID="800523">&lt;b&gt;What innovation!&lt;/b&gt; A bright young spark applies some of the latest forensic researches. The knife used to cut the midhipman's neck is placed inside an airtight box along with vapours belonging to the doctor. As if by magic, when removed, clear sets of fingerprints appear on the shaft! When the crew prints are taken, the guilty party is collared in the most satisfying modern fashion!</Text>
  <Text ID="800524">&lt;b&gt;It's complicated&lt;/b&gt; identifying footwear and gait. Ambitious of the crew then, to attempt to solve both problems with the one device. Still the notched stick-wheel does prove footprints at the scene are suspicious, and that suspects are limited to just a few matches. But how to get to the bottom of this?</Text>
  <Text ID="800526">Let there be a trial</Text>
  <Text ID="800529">&lt;b&gt;The trial goes as well as can be expected.&lt;/b&gt; The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was  trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.</Text>
  <Text ID="800530">&lt;b&gt;The trial is a farce.&lt;/b&gt; Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered. But this obstinacy serves only to rile the shouting mob! They flood through the makeshift courtroom and carry the suspects kicking and screaming to deck, before tossing them over the side. </Text>
  <Text ID="800527">Put the fear of god into the suspects </Text>
  <Text ID="800532">&lt;b&gt;It's almost like divine intervention.&lt;/b&gt; The priest hears each suspect alone, and once the god-fearing killer breaks down and confesses, he is handed his rope. Still, a lack of forgiveness does not trouble the crew, who are relieved this ungodly chapter is now closed.    </Text>
  <Text ID="800533">&lt;b&gt;These are not god-fearing sailors,&lt;/b&gt; and hear the priest's weak plea for the killer to come forward with impassive expressions. Perhaps there is a different approach.</Text>
  <Text ID="800528">Dump all the suspects at the next port, and be done with it</Text>
  <Text ID="800534">The Singular Case of the Midshipman</Text>
  <Text ID="800525">&lt;b&gt;Fragile justice!&lt;/b&gt; As your craftsmen stare at an empty drawing board, gormless sailors think they help by tidying up the crime scene. With the investigation fumbled, the killer feels he has to take two more lives before he is finally caught. "Can't believe how sloppy you are in the art of policing," he teases, "I could have killed ten more before you'd found me." Caught he may be, but the damage is already done. </Text>
  <Text ID="800511">&lt;b&gt;This lot aren't bloodhounds that's for sure,&lt;/b&gt; and turn up nothing even with a strong whiff of murder about it all. With the incompetent investigation ending conspicuously silent, the crew must last the remainder of the expedition in fear they are marked next on the list.</Text>
  <Text ID="800508">Do nothing, it's suicide - nothing more to be said</Text>
  <Text ID="800698">&lt;b&gt;Widespread suspicion is the undesirable outcome.&lt;/b&gt; Ignorance of the full circumstances surrounding the death has the crew feeling powerless. You must accept that quarrels and accusations will now be routine until the end of this expedition.</Text>

  <Text ID="800008">"A new course must be plotted," insists the ship's second navigator, after crashing in through the door during the small hours. Asked to explain himself, he fancifully blames, "a sudden shift in the position of the stars", as if the cosmos itself were in turmoil.</Text>

  <Text ID="800024">The clergyman somewhat calms the navigator, encouraging him to re-check the position of the stars. He is now not so certain of his initial claims. No new course is plotted, and the rest of the night passes without incident.</Text>
  <Text ID="800025">The clergyman is unable to placate the young navigator, and therefore advises he be confined to his bunk for the night. Unfortunately, his tossing and turning mean his bunkmates hardly sleep a wink. </Text>

  <Text ID="800053">A cry of "Fog!" pierces the stillness, when before the going was easy. Before long all billow has dropped from the sails. Kelp fingers reach up from the deep as if to grasp the keel, and the ship drifts to a stop. Sure enough, a dense fog descends, through which the panicked crew cannot see more than five paces.</Text>

The few remaining crew count missing comrades  and cargo in mournful silence.      </Text>

  <Text ID="800057">The fog grows ever denser, and the crew begin to sweat as if under the hottest noon sun.

Porto Fogo's tropical shoreline twinkles, its white walls glow. But as you draw toward the terracotta rooftops, you find not the warm welcome you were expecting. &lt;b&gt;The place is crawling with La Corona.&lt;/b&gt; They have driven Isabel's freedom fighters away, who it seems until recently had been holding out. You have to discover the location of the secret camp to which the rebels have now been taken.</Text>

A fire prevails in its centre, and at your arrival, figures about it stand and draw their weapons. The foremost of them has a face most charismatic, a picture of defiance. </Text>
  <Text ID="800749">Build a raft and take the quicker river route</Text>
  <Text ID="800765">&lt;b&gt;It holds well enough,&lt;/b&gt; accommodating all. The current is getting stronger, as if up ahead some hazard awaits. "I don't know if she'll take a bump," says the captain.  </Text>
  <Text ID="800767">Disembark and follow the map instead</Text>
  <Text ID="800773">&lt;b&gt;"Bingo!"&lt;/b&gt; bark your proud orienteers, pointing at the tunnels. "Guerrilla tubes," says the captain with a sage nod. They match the map, leading to a promising cleft in rock. Could this be the domain of the elusive Sarmento?! Oil lamps light the way to a large cavern. A fire prevails in its centre, and at your arrival, figures about it stand and draw their weapons. The foremost of them has a face most charismatic, a picture of defiance. </Text>
  <Text ID="800774">&lt;b&gt;"Why didn't we stick to the map?"&lt;/b&gt; lament the crew. But the lure of guerilla tunnels they found beside the river was too much. After crawling forever, they come to an opening. Above, a battery of guns are trained on their heads.&lt;b&gt;"One false move and we kill you,"&lt;/b&gt; growls their leader. It appears these are Isabel's people. If only you could prove you share in their cause.</Text>
  <Text ID="800768">Reinforce the raft and keep paddling</Text>
  <Text ID="800775">&lt;b&gt;Huzzah for bootlaces!&lt;/b&gt; The tightly-wound logs bounce over the edge..."Waaaaaah! What a thrill!" exclaims the captain, as you splash into the clear pool. Beside it is a promising cleft in the rock. Could this be the domain of the elusive Sarmento?! Oil lamps light the way to a large cavern. A fire prevails in its centre, and at your arrival, figures about it stand and draw their weapons. The foremost of them has a face most charismatic, a picture of defiance. </Text>
  <Text ID="800776">&lt;b&gt;Not sturdy enough!&lt;/b&gt; A hard knock on the rapids leaves your men clutching timber. It is only then they realise there have attracted spectators. There is laughter from the riverbank, before the bystanders pull them from the water at gunpoint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;"One false move and we kill you,"&lt;/b&gt; growls their leader. It appears these are Isabel's people. If only you could prove you share in their cause.</Text>

  <Text ID="802852">The Iron Dragon</Text>
  <Text ID="802853">&lt;b&gt;Cornered by a fearsome Pyrphorian vessel!&lt;/b&gt; Your expedition has reached South America at last, and all look forward to some well-earned rest. Night has fallen and your ship is already in the tranquil bay, when the look out screams "behind us!" There, looming from the darkness, gleams a dragon of iron, its nostrils livid with fire. "The same dire vessel of Mr. Goode's murderer, but more than twice the size! We are at their mercy." The bay is hidden from the bright gaze of the moon, however, and it is possible the dragon has not yet spotted you. If you choose to show yourself, you cannot expect to be a match for the dragon, only to somehow hinder it long enough to flee.</Text>
  <Text ID="802854">Fight your way out</Text>
  <Text ID="802855">&lt;b&gt;Your aim is true, but the dragon is gathering its hot breath.&lt;/b&gt; To engage with the hulking vessel is a humbling experience— the size, the power, the feet-thick armoured hull that your ordnance seems only to bounce limply off. The crew seem defeated until they realise their precise fire at the dragon's stern, while showing no external sign of damage, appears to have caused a problem in the engine room. As a response, masked figures rush to prime the beastly mouth—a great cannon of fire! You must act quickly.</Text>
  <Text ID="802856">Maintain your fire on the weakened engine</Text>
  <Text ID="802857">&lt;b&gt;Your crew cheer the cannoneers,&lt;/b&gt; one good hit to the same spot does the trick! There are loud rasping noises, before the ironclad's engines fall silent, and the great monstrosity drifts to a gentle halt. As your crew escape, they are forced to pass close by the enemy— to see the gnarled and hateful iron of the bows and boards, the army of mocking masks, and the firepit of a mouth that could easily have been their end. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery. You make camp in a secluded inlet further up the coast, confident it will keep you well-hidden.</Text>
  <Text ID="802858">&lt;b&gt;The aim isn't quite as good this time.&lt;/b&gt; Your lead rolls around the solid iron deck like balls of ivory on a bagatelle board, barely making a dent. The iron dragon's mouth yawns wide above your little boat, and from it the first plume of fire melts the men at the taffrail. The two hulls are close enough for boarding, but there are just too many of the rogues. Your only options are to cause confusion by throwing some of your stink-pot grenados, or to target the flaming cannon itself.</Text>
  <Text ID="802859">Aim to disable the dread cannon</Text>
  <Text ID="802860">&lt;b&gt;The shot is good enough.&lt;/b&gt; A canister of gas fueling their weapon whistles free of its housing, and blows fire spasmodically about the deck. Some of the mystery of the enemy disappears in that instant, as the cowled crows fight to regain control.

  <Text ID="802861">&lt;b&gt;The shot is good, but takes too long to line up.&lt;/b&gt; You are very close to the dragon's mouth when it is hit, and the eruption of flaming debris is most violent! Your own ship and men are on the receving end, taking damage and casualties. Luckily, there is chaos enough aboard the Pyrphorian ship for your crew to hightail it out of the bay. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery.

  <Text ID="802862">Aim some grenados toward the enemy deck</Text>
  <Text ID="802863">&lt;b&gt;The explosion drowns the enemy in a cloud of stench.&lt;/b&gt; The coughing and groaning is only the after-effect of the salvo of the grenados, whose shrapnel penetrates the crowd of crows.

  <Text ID="802894">&lt;b&gt;The masterful navigator swings the ship into a serendipitous breeze!&lt;/b&gt;Carving up the bay on a beam reach, the billowing sails bearing your company crest leave the iron dragon standing.

You'll have to send a team of saboteurs to destroy that cannon before it can be reloaded, or else even the odds and try to slow the great dragon.</Text>
  <Text ID="802869">Send a team to sabotage the fiery cannon</Text>
  <Text ID="802870">&lt;b&gt;Your soldiers leap across like olympians, as the two ships pass.&lt;/b&gt;The Pyrphorians above the iron deck are few. Holes are blown in the gleeful masks of their welcome party, and fighting their way to the cannon, several of your men engage its operators, while the rest disconnect the fuel tank and toss it overboard. More masks come from below, and your men dive into the water. "If not now, we'll take you later," the thwarted enemy cry, as most of your brave saboteurs clamber back aboard, and your ship speeds away.

  <Text ID="802871">&lt;b&gt;It is bold, but the Pyrphorians above the iron deck are stronger.&lt;/b&gt; Your soldiers leap across, trying to fight their way to the cannon. More masks come from below the gnarled iron deck, and your saboteurs are doomed. To ensure their sacrifice is not in vain, your quick-thinking steersman takes advantage of the chaos and forces your ship past the enemy— in time to see the army of mocking masks running your men through—and out of the bay to safety. The expedition may be free to find Sarmento now, but it is worrying that the Pyrphorians seem a step ahead, and possessed of such fearful machinery.

  <Text ID="802872">Aim at the engine to immoblise the Dragon.</Text>
  <Text ID="802873">&lt;b&gt;The dragon is thwarted,&lt;/b&gt; though it catches your ship and crew with one final breath of fire. Nevertheless your lucky hit to its stern has done the trick.

  <Text ID="802878">Take advantage of the darkness and try to sneak by</Text>
  <Text ID="802879">&lt;b&gt;Your ship moves in absolute silence,&lt;/b&gt; all its light extinguished. The iron dragon cannot have spotted you, or it would surely have changed course. The darkness makes navigating the bay harder however, and the crew are under a misapprehension about the depth of this bay. You are almost clear, when a loud sound resonates as the hull touches the bottom, the iron dragon, though some distance away, now begins to turn. You can try to manouevre out of the shallows and flee, or turn and face them, still with some advantage of surprise.</Text>
  <Text ID="802880">Ambush the Pyrophorian ship</Text>

  <Text ID="802944">Finding Sarmento</Text>
  <Text ID="802945">&lt;b&gt;"I'll mark her on the map with an S!"&lt;/b&gt; says local man Ramón whom Sir Archibald sent to accompany you. "Why not an X?" says the captain with an air of disappointment. "Sarmento!" says Ramón, his eyes sparkling with life, "finding her is the key to everything. Having travelled for many days along the New World coast, &lt;b&gt;it is now time to decide how you will travel on from here.&lt;/b&gt; Ahead, a broad brown rivermouth invites you upstream, its perils waiting unseen beyond its bends. "Perhaps a route overland will be more forgiving?" says the navigator hopefully. One look at the dark and foreboding line of trees would suggest nothing could be further from the truth. "But which is the lesser of evils, Admiral?"</Text>
  <Text ID="802946">Take the ship upriver</Text>
  <Text ID="802947">&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian dragon is back on your tail!&lt;/b&gt; It seems hard to believe at first, the distant chugging of an engine, the bluck smudge of smoke above the ragged line of clawfoot mangrove. Your men, who had setlled enough to admire a proliferation of yellow flowers on the southern bank, suddenly find themselves at the mercy of twin horrors! For beyond the next bend, with the Pyrphorian dragon fast approaching, are a set of &lt;b&gt;devious rapids&lt;/b&gt; frothing down towards you. There is a very narrow breach at one side, through which a vessel capably navigated, may just fit. Alternatively, blasting the high cliffs could block the Pyrphorian's way.</Text>
  <Text ID="802948">Fill the sails and power up the rapids</Text>
  <Text ID="802949">&lt;b&gt;Your navigator picks up plenty of speed,&lt;/b&gt; which is remarkable, since there seems little wind on the river today. The line of approach is good too, splitting the two craggiest protuberances of rock, and your ship rides up several tiers of the rapids with little more than a bump. Though a steamer might be better suited to the task, the iron dragon makes no attempt to pursue. Your captain is quick to praise the great skill of your navigator, rather than face the troubling possibility the Pyrphorians know of a greater danger to come. &lt;b&gt;The river has taken you as far as it can,&lt;/b&gt; and you must decide whether to continue across a marsh of uncertain depth, or as Ramón suggests, through a nearby network of caves.</Text>
  <Text ID="802950">Cautiously enter the marshes</Text>
  <Text ID="802951">&lt;b&gt;Your men know those aren't logs bobbing on the marsh,&lt;/b&gt; and wades well clear of the lurking black caiman, who from their chubby bellies appear to have had success in these waters. After a few cheerful hours of tramping, you reach a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?" A young sailor reveals a mossy bunker in the forest carpet, "long since deserted," he laughs, "your information must be out of date, Ramón." "Many years out of date," calls a voice from the trees. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around. "You!" a cowled man appears and points in your direction, "come with us." You are shackled and blindfolded, and after a boat journey, find yourself before the woman you believe to be &lt;b&gt;Isabel Sarmento.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;"Who are you?" she demands, "why are you here?"&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
  <Text ID="802952">&lt;b&gt;A wader is too occuped with the myth of fifty-foot anaconda,&lt;/b&gt; to see the real danger. The mass of driftwood he reaches for are in fact caiman, sinking their teeth deep into his torso, for which there will be no remedy. Hours of pensive tramping later, your expedition coems to a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?"

  <Text ID="802953">Find a way through the caves</Text>
  <Text ID="802954">&lt;b&gt;Several members of the expedition are experienced cavers,&lt;/b&gt; and the screech of bats and mountains of guano are about the worst of it.

  <Text ID="802955">&lt;b&gt;Ramón apologises but it's not his fault.&lt;/b&gt;You have descended too far, and are forced to squeeze on your bellies through mud and guano. A chlostrophobe faints.

  <Text ID="802956">&lt;b&gt;Your navigator can gather no speed,&lt;/b&gt; which is hardly surprising, since there seems little wind on the river today. As a result of his attempts to catch the merest breeze, the line of approach is also poor, and two of the craggiest protuberances of rock make themselves known. There is a sharp splintering as your poor ship's hull suffers what it was never built for, riding up and over the tiered association of white water pools. Your damaged hull begins to flood, and though you see the Iron Dragon turn tail and puff downstream, you must now decide whether to &lt;b&gt;fix or forsake your ship.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802957">Disembark and search for Isabel on foot</Text>
  <Text ID="802958">&lt;b&gt;Large and luminous eyes light the way,&lt;/b&gt; now night has fallen, but for a few peeking stars in the canopy well-known to your navigators. An impromptu camp is made for the night somewhere near the S of your map. In the morning, all wake to a seemingly unremarkable clearing. "But what's this?"

  <Text ID="802961">&lt;b&gt;Ramón apologises, but it's not his fault.&lt;/b&gt;You have descended too far, and are forced to squeeze on your bellies through red mud and guano. A chlostrophobe faints. After a few exhausting hours, all emerge to a seemingly unremarkable clearing above the S marked on your map. "But what's this?"

  <Text ID="802962">&lt;b&gt;It would be easier to build a new boat,&lt;/b&gt; is the verdict of your carpenters, though they spend hours trying to find the right wood to help with the repairs. The black wood they select is extremely hard to cut, and heavy to carry. All the while they have the feeling they are being watched. Exhausted with the lack of progress, they are reclining on a sandy stretch of the river bank when they hear a clicking sound. There is a rustle of foliage, as rifles poke through all around.

  <Text ID="802963">Fire at the cliff between you and the Pyrphorians</Text>
  <Text ID="802964">&lt;b&gt;The cannonfire has precisely the desired effect.&lt;/b&gt; A bellowing crack, and the high cliff spills several hundred tonnes of orange sandstone into the river. Having contemplated this new obstacle, the Iron Dragon turns, and disappears back downstream. With the rapids ahead, you are forced to admit &lt;b&gt;the river has taken you as far as it can.&lt;/b&gt; You must decide whether to continue across a marsh of uncertain depth, or as Ramón suggests, through a nearby network of caves.</Text>
  <Text ID="802965">&lt;b&gt;Too little rock falls in time.&lt;/b&gt;The small shower of sandstone does not deter the Pyrphorians, and you are left with no choice but to try to sail up the rapids. There is a sharp splintering as your poor ship's hull suffers what it was never built for, riding up and over the tiered association of white water pools. Your damaged hull begins to flood, and though you see the Iron Dragon turn tail and puff downstream, you must now decide whether to &lt;b&gt;fix or forsake your ship.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="802966">Head into the jungle</Text>
  <Text ID="802967">&lt;b&gt;An expedition party leaves the ship in capable hands,&lt;/b&gt; and sets out into the vast green. It is hard to relate the enchantment that falls upon those adventurers, to whom this alien world is entirely new, from the whoop and squawk of feathers and the gleeful chattering of capuchin. An ocelot scarpers, a serpent slumbers. Ants bear all the burdens of their kingdom along their leafy conduits, their royal quest in parallel to your own. After several hours of happy tramping, you reach a steep but narrow ravine. If the map suggests some natural bridge across, you do not see it, and the breach in the earth stretches out of sight in either direction. Either you &lt;b&gt;go down and back up with ropes,&lt;/b&gt; or try to &lt;b&gt;construct a simple bridge.&lt;/b&gt; </Text>
  <Text ID="802968">Somehow construct a bridge</Text>
  <Text ID="802969">&lt;b&gt;They have no problem finding a tall enough tree.&lt;/b&gt; It is felled and hollowed, at least to provide some protection from a fall, and the ropes are used to secure it at either end. It is a tidy job, and your expedition passes over it in relative comfort. On the other side it is not long before Ramón, Sir Archibald's man, alerts you to prints that have disturbed the red earth. Human ones. Perhaps these lead right to Isabel Sarmento? But that would mean deviating from the route on the map, and the day is beginning to grow dark.  </Text>

He is right of course, since there is nothing to cling to but the frangible bark, and several of your expedition are even very close to falling before one finally does. "Don't look! She's gone!"

  <Text ID="803001">&lt;b&gt;"You think I care about your stupid empire?!"&lt;/b&gt; curses Isabel, beckoning to two guards to tightly restrain you. "No sooner do we gain independence from La Corona, we receive an offer too-goo-to-be-true from an envoy of your Queen. An 'amazing prospect, Prosperity', he said, and at first it was." Isabel grunts and slams her bootknife into a barrel, from which wine spurts. "Now that island, our last hope of freedom, is overrun with these masks, these...twisted people, and their fire!" &lt;b&gt;She rushes at you, and forces your lips open for a better answer...&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="803002">"My father was Samuel Goode. I am here to stop the Pyrphorians!"</Text>
  <Text ID="803004">&lt;b&gt;Isabel slowly releases her grip.&lt;/b&gt; She stabs her bootknife back into the wine barrel, plugging the hole. "Then you are against the Pyrphorians. I heard reports they tried to stop you with an iron dragon." She exhales nervously. "I did not believe it. And yet, you have risked your life to come here..." Isabel motions her guards to release you, "...I should at least hear what you are planning to do about all this."</Text>
  <Text ID="803003">"My father was Samuel Goode. I am here to take Prosperity back!"</Text>
  <Text ID="803005">&lt;b&gt;Isabel's eyes flash with anger.&lt;/b&gt; "So!

  <Text ID="803012">&lt;b&gt;Isabel sighs, and puts her knife down.&lt;/b&gt; She rests her hands on the window ledge, to gaze across the turquoise waters. "Then you are against the Pyrphorians.

  <Text ID="801664">Pyrphorian Pursuit</Text>
  <Text ID="801665">&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorians are escaping with the contract!&lt;/b&gt; The smoke of battle has screened a small craft, that is now racing clear of the skirmish! The entire assault must have been a diversion to sneak them in and out with the papers! You and Hannah may never know the truth unless you get them back. They have quite a headstart, but you might catch them in a chase. Alternatively, as few harbours nearby will grant them sanctuary, you can try to anticipate their likely heading.</Text>
  <Text ID="801666">Let them run, and instead try to establish their likely destination</Text>
  <Text ID="801668">&lt;b&gt;"There! We have them," your navigator smiles.&lt;/b&gt; "See? Here." The finger traces a route behind Ventura island. "Remarkable how few options they have. Montoya is the only port they might blend in for fifty leagues." Sure enough, you intercept one of the tiny vessels off Montoya's twinkling bay. It may be no match for your own ship, but to sink them outright risks losing that precious contract to the water.</Text>
  <Text ID="801670">Try to disable them</Text>
  <Text ID="801671">&lt;b&gt;Crackerjack! The perfect shot.&lt;/b&gt; Though a slender target, the mast snaps through, burying its operators in debris, and leaving the boat dead in the water. With the freedom of their ship, your crew find an ingenious-looking machine, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Nevertheless, you are certain it must therefore have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801672">&lt;b&gt;Only a partial success&lt;/b&gt;, as the fire forces the Pyrphorians to turn to face you. Sensing they might still have a chance in a fight, the Pyrphorians prime what few small dragon cannons they have. Your crew must act quickly.</Text>
  <Text ID="801674">Swing over to their ship and get among them</Text>
  <Text ID="801675">Continue to target the mast and rigging</Text>
  <Text ID="801676">&lt;b&gt;Woomph!&lt;/b&gt; Your brutes descend like gibbons on lianas. What few cultists aboard are ruthlessly dispatched. With the freedom of their ship, your crew find some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Nevertheless, you are certain it must therefore have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801677">&lt;b&gt;What a rabble!&lt;/b&gt; Like some arrhythmic jingle of bell-ringers, your thugs mistime their swings, falling to the channel between the two vessels. The Pyrphorians make their escape, but you know they are headed. If your crew manage to recover both themselves and their dignity, you will make a beeline for the port of Montoya.</Text>
  <Text ID="801678">&lt;b&gt;It works this time.&lt;/b&gt; With a shorter range to target, your competent cannoneers have no trouble picking out the mast. It buries the enemy in debris, and leaves the sail-less boat adrift. With the freedom of their ship, your crew find some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801679">&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian ship is agile.&lt;/b&gt; "Never seen an enemy move like that," explains one of your cannoneers, as if to avoid some weeping confession of his inexperience. Sensing they may be a match after all, the Pyrphorians use what firepower they have, giving your ship a fair lick of flame. The ensuing panic gives them time to slip away. You will no doubt pick up their trail again in the port of Montoya, but the fire has caused damage that must be repaired first.</Text>
  <Text ID="801673">&lt;b&gt;Miles off!&lt;/b&gt; Your novice gunners are so desperate to avoid striking the enemy in any meaningful way, that a small inoffensive patch of sea takes the brunt instead. Sensing their tiny ship is a match for yours after all, the Pyrphorians pump flame from dragon cannons, and give your ship a good licking. The ensuing panic gives them time to slip away. You will no doubt pick up their trail again in the port of Montoya, but the fire has caused significant damage that must be repaired first.</Text>
  <Text ID="801680">Try to board them</Text>
  <Text ID="801681">&lt;b&gt;Your crew lick their lips.&lt;/b&gt; You thought they seemed the types to enjoy tussles at close quarters, and so it proves. Cloaks drop all around and with them dead the ship is yours. Your crew find an ingenious-looking machine aboard, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801682">&lt;b&gt;Your sailors cannot disguise what they intend.&lt;/b&gt; As your ship readies to join theirs at the hip, the Pyrphorians yank night palls away to reveal a line of signature dragon guns. They will burn anyone who tries to come near...</Text>
  <Text ID="801683">Snipe the cannon operators one-by-one</Text>
  <Text ID="801685">&lt;b&gt;The cowled figures fall like beetles swept from a window ledge.&lt;/b&gt; Your marksmen pause to survey the scene, "a fearful desire these Pyrphorians have to die for their cause..." says one wistfully. Picking through their ship reveals some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801686">&lt;b&gt;The shot seems to pass through them,&lt;/b&gt; as if beneath mask and cloak their bodies are incorporeal, or perhaps your marksmen are drunk. Either way, it allows the Pyrphorians to turn and catch a strong westerly squall. They are halfway to the bay of Montoya before your sailors can reposition. You will have to rely on picking up their trail when you get there.</Text>
  <Text ID="801687">Train your main guns on their cannons</Text>
  <Text ID="801688">&lt;b&gt;Destructive, but effective.&lt;/b&gt; Shot explodes onto the Pyrphorian deck, and the weighty flame cannons drop through the boards. With the freedom of the ship, your crew find some arcane Pyrphorian devices, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Knowing it can only have changed hands in nearby Montoya, you make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801689">&lt;b&gt;Your fool cannoneers sank them!&lt;/b&gt; Exactly what they weren't supposed to do. Several miserable hours are spent combing the soggy wreckage, with no sign of the contract. "You won't find it," a bloody-mouthed Pyrphorian grins, but his dying taunt is a clue. He implies the contract changed hands before you intercepted the ship. Being the only haven for miles around, you set a course for the port of Montoya.</Text>
  <Text ID="801690">&lt;b&gt;Your soldiers lack initiative&lt;/b&gt;, and it is the Pyrphorians who swing aboard your ship, brandishing torches and firing elegant pocket pistols. Though their zeal cannot be matched, they are outnumbered. By the time they are subdued, they have pinned two, and burned many others. The accomplices in their boat are already halfway to Montoya. Once your groaning survivors have been gauzed-up, you might still find them there. </Text>
  <Text ID="801691">&lt;b&gt;"Hmmn..." your navigator mumbles awkwardly&lt;/b&gt;, realising he has proposed almost every one of the myriad small harbours in the region. Someone coughs. Perhaps all these officers have been summoned to the cabin merely to share in his humiliation? "We have lost them then..." a skeptic pipes up, addressing the elephant in the room. "So what now?! Search every harbour?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"  </Text>
  <Text ID="801692">Check every nearby harbour in the hope of finding them</Text>
  <Text ID="801693">&lt;b&gt;The clouds finally part over Montoya.&lt;/b&gt; Your crew had been about to give up, until by chance, on of them caught sight of a ship. Moored in a secluded corner of the bay, it is the empty, but unmistakable property of the shadow Pyrphorians you pursued. The contract must surely still be somewhere here in Montoya.</Text>
  <Text ID="801694">&lt;b&gt;Needles and haystacks.&lt;/b&gt; You exhaust all feasible harbours. Not only is there no sign of your quarry, there is no method of knowing whether they have been and gone from a place, or if they were never there at all. The sea seems godless, wide and deep, and the crew long for it to swallow them up. Instead, however, they must return to Miss Hannah Goode, to explain their failure.</Text>
  <Text ID="801695">Entreat the local authorities for information</Text>
  <Text ID="801696">&lt;b&gt;You are made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember this local crest as one loyal to the crown, but you are not the only envoys present. Daiquiris, bananas and soft furnishings are small compensation for the time lost. Despite these formalities, the prefect transpires to be loyal. He intimates that Montoya is the only nearby place he has knowledge of, that the Pyrphorians have their claws into. You cross fingers, and head there.</Text>
  <Text ID="801697">&lt;b&gt;"They must have been in league with the Pyrphorians!"&lt;/b&gt; wails your duped diplomat. Having failed to detect local complicity— rooted either in fear or allegiance— your diplomat insists you sail south along the coast. Your expedition continues diligently for three days in that direction without sighting a single human settlement. "Since you're so fine with words," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain our failure to Miss. Hannah Goode!"</Text>
  <Text ID="801698">Trust your lookouts to keep you in range</Text>
  <Text ID="801699">&lt;b&gt;The lookout never loses them&lt;/b&gt;, despite the vessel being nearly out of sight. As its small grey outline rounds an island, the lookout gestures excitedly to starboard. He has seen the golden thread of an inlet, by the navigation of which you may cut the nose off the cape, and intercept the Pyrphorians on the other side.</Text>
  <Text ID="801700">Take a shortcut via the inlet</Text>
  <Text ID="801701">&lt;b&gt;You emerge right on top of them!&lt;/b&gt; Swinging masterfully through the stone jaws that gate the inlet, your navigators traverse a fantasy lagoon. Bursting beyond it to the bay, their ambush is received with complete surprise. With the freedom of the Pyrphorian ship, your crew find an ingenious-looking machine, but no sign of the Prosperity contract. Nevertheless, you are certain it must therefore have changed hands in nearby Montoya, and make a beeline for the port.</Text>
  <Text ID="801702">&lt;b&gt;It is clear now why the Pyrphorians did not use the inlet themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps they were more willing to admit they had not the skill to navigate it without risking their ship. The inlet chokes, and a tooth-like incisor of rock rakes the boards from your hull. Limping out on the other side, you have made up the distance enough to see the Pyrphorians are headed to the port of Montoya. Your crew are very glad, since your ship is now in dire need of repair. </Text>
  <Text ID="801703">Maintain course, following them around the island</Text>
  <Text ID="801704">&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorians realise they must make port or be caught.&lt;/b&gt; As you round the cape, you see they are headed for the nearby settlement of Montoya. "Though we may not have caught them by sea," says your navigator, "they may have given away much more in leading us here; the only such haven for miles around." </Text>
  <Text ID="801705">&lt;b&gt;The lookout loses them.&lt;/b&gt; Complacency sets in, when at first you appear to be catching them, but upon rounding a cape, you find they have vanished! Bright white settlements cluster the sound like a fairy circle, it seems they could have docked in any of them. "We have lost them!" a skeptic pipes up, "so what now?! Stick a pin in the map?! Solicit a friendly local power for help?!!"</Text>
  <Text ID="801706">Study the map to guess their most likely docking point</Text>
  <Text ID="801707">&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as sure of himself&lt;/b&gt; as he can be in the circumstances. "If I were Pyrphorian, god help me, I would head for Montoya," his finger circles the large settlement, "it has a large marina where my devilish vessel might be easily concealed." Upon searching Montoya harbour, they indeed find the Pyrphorian ship in a secluded corner of mangrove. That being well, they must hope now they have not lost too much time.</Text>
  <Text ID="801708">&lt;b&gt;The navigator is as much as a failure as the lookout.&lt;/b&gt; Your ship makes a cat's cradle of the sound, as the navigator drags you hopelessly from one port to the next, almost at random. "Since you're so fine with directions," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain where it was we went off course to Miss. Hannah Goode!" </Text>
  <Text ID="801709">Entreat nearby local authorities for information</Text>
  <Text ID="801710">&lt;b&gt;You are made to wait in line.&lt;/b&gt; Your diplomats may have done well to remember this local crest as one loyal to the crown, but you are not the only envoys present. Daiquiris, bananas and soft furnishings are small compensation for the time lost. Despite these formalities, the prefect transpires to be loyal. He intimates that Montoya is the only nearby place he has knowledge of, that the Pyrphorians have their claws into. You cross fingers, and head there.</Text>
  <Text ID="801711">&lt;b&gt;"They must have been in league with the Pyrphorians!"&lt;/b&gt; wails your duped diplomat. Having failed to detect local complicity— rooted either in fear or allegiance— your diplomat insists you sail south along the coast. Your expedition continues diligently for three days in that direction without sighting a single human settlement. "Since you're so fine with words," says the lieutenant to the diplomat in question, "perhaps you should explain our failure to Miss. Hannah Goode!"</Text>
  <Text ID="801714">Montoya</Text>
  <Text ID="801712">&lt;b&gt;The contract and those Pyrphorians must be here in Montoya, but where?&lt;/b&gt; The city sprawls before you under a pastel blue sky, the distinctive whitewall and terracotta of Imperial La Corona glowing softly all along the narrow estuary where the Mixcoatl meets the ocean. Yet, tranquil it is not. Anxiety is written in every passing face. They must know who you are and what you seek, but finding one brave enough to share is a different matter. You can ask around, or rely instead on your own eyes to find clues.</Text>
  <Text ID="801715">Ask the local Montoyans if they know anything</Text>
  <Text ID="801716">&lt;b&gt;Your attaché hits it off with the harbourmaster&lt;/b&gt;, presenting you (not entirely falsely) as a fellow port official sympathetic to the Pyrphorian problem in the region. "I am sick of it," says the Montoyan, "whenever they come here it is a nightmare for us! If you take will action, it will be my pleasure to assist." Out on the sun-baked rooftop he points upriver. "There, at the casona." A large verdant ranch wavers in the distance, the sanctuary of the Pyrphorians.</Text>
  <Text ID="801717">&lt;b&gt;The only one who may be willing to help you is a Great Plainsman.&lt;/b&gt; The softly-spoken giant is hauling thick rope at the dock. "I would be putting my life at risk," he says gravely, looking over his shoulder. He seems to know something.</Text>
  <Text ID="801750">A little recompense always calms the nerves</Text>
  <Text ID="801718">The Great Plainsman looks nervously over your goods.</Text>
  <Text ID="801998">Bribe</Text>
  <Text ID="801721">&lt;b&gt;"That should be enough to get me out of here,"&lt;/b&gt; he says, inspecting the merchandise. "They have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. You'll need a lot more than this if you hoping to break in— see all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, to where darkness awaits.</Text>
  <Text ID="801751">Cancel</Text>
  <Text ID="801722">&lt;b&gt;"No!" he says&lt;/b&gt;, unwilling to risk his life for such scant reward. He glances around, sweeping back his long dark hair. It seems increasingly unlikely he will co-operate.</Text>
  <Text ID="801719">Threaten it out of him</Text>
  <Text ID="801723">&lt;b&gt;He raises his hands, impressed, while remaining wary.&lt;/b&gt; "Perhaps you can be the ones to finally unseat them," he says, pointing upriver, "they have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. When you go there, expect trouble." He looks your soldiers up and down again, "even if you do seem prepared."</Text>
  <Text ID="801724">&lt;b&gt;"Seen enough of that in my lifetime,"&lt;/b&gt; he says with quiet defiance. Your soldiers hang their heads— with the Pyrphorians here, Montoyans hardly need you stirring up more trouble. "If all you have to offer is violence, take it to those who deserve it," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse towards the end of the quay. Then he disappears without so much as a farewell. </Text>
  <Text ID="801720">Reassure him</Text>
  <Text ID="801725">&lt;b&gt;"Your envoy is right," he says&lt;/b&gt;, "I can cover my tracks well enough." He nods upriver. "They have taken the big ranch for their gatherings. You better be ready if you hope to break in— see all these people? There's a reason they're afraid." You head for the ranch on the outskirts of Montoya, to where darkness awaits.</Text>
  <Text ID="801726">&lt;b&gt;He sighs deeply and rolls his eyes.&lt;/b&gt; "If you can't convince me, good luck convincing them to stop what they have begun," he says, gesturing at a decrepit-looking warehouse at the end of the quay. Then he disappears without so much as a farewell. </Text>
  <Text ID="801727">&lt;b&gt;Your attaché's weepy plea&lt;/b&gt; is better received than anyone who had to hear it could have expected. "Of course we will help you stand against this terrible evil!" A local man says cheerfully, leading you to the end of the pier, where &lt;b&gt;a rather decrepit warehouse stands&lt;/b&gt;. "This is it, we're all counting on you," he whispers encouragingly at the door, before hurrying away.</Text>
  <Text ID="801728">Smash down the warehouse door and charge in</Text>
  <Text ID="801729">&lt;b&gt;Of course, the Pyrphorians have been waiting.&lt;/b&gt; The warehouse appears to be workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. Bullets ting through the many hundred stone representations of the goddess Pyr, as bodies drop on both sides. Eventually, the cultists prove too few. Having honoured the dead, you conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor, it is a Pyrphorian paper tract— an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text>
  <Text ID="801730">&lt;b&gt;Your feeble bunch finally edge open the heavy door&lt;/b&gt;, only to find the building deserted. That it is owned by the Pyrphorians there is no doubt. Carmine drapes smother the windows, and your people find themselves picking over the cult's instruments, whose purpose is unsettlingly opaque. "What's this oily liquid on the floor," someone says, just as the door slams shut, and is followed by the hasty rattle of padlock and keys. The Pyrphorian fire will burn bright and long at the quayside this night. Only one of your crew return home.</Text>
  <Text ID="801731">Find some way to sneak inside</Text>
  <Text ID="801732">&lt;b&gt;Your crew stalk noiselessly around the back.&lt;/b&gt; Scaling the wall they find an open window obscured by a heavy carmine drape. Peering beyond it, they see a workshop for the production of devotional sculptures, its tables now flipped into barricades. With the cultists' attentions fixed on the main door, you are able to ambush them before it turns into a gunfight, but that doesn't stop two of your own being shot dead. Having honoured the dead, your survivors conduct a search. There is no contract, but a fiery oculus stares up from the floor, it is a Pyrphorian paper tract— an invitation to a rally at the Casado estate.</Text>
  <Text ID="801733">&lt;b&gt;They thought they had been quiet as church mice&lt;/b&gt;, but rounding the corner at the back of the warehouse, they have a nasty shock. Upon the balcony above, where you might have thought to gain entry to the warehouse, stands a single Pyrphorian clad in heavy garb, in his hands a long brass pipe from the aperture of which erupts a searing cone of fire. Your people spread and dive for the sea, and the Pyrphorians torch your ship. Only one of your crew return home.</Text>
  <Text ID="801734">Fan through the city, looking for clues.</Text>
  <Text ID="801735">&lt;b&gt;Your scouts pick up the scent immediately.&lt;/b&gt; "We recognised them as the fugitives from the boat we pursued, and followed them through Montoya to its outskirts. Up in the valley there is a sizeable house on a large estate. They must have taken the contract there." You set off at once.</Text>
  <Text ID="801736">&lt;b&gt;It seems the Pyrphorians have split.&lt;/b&gt; One you trace as far as the church, the other to a house of ill-repute— alternate refuges of the typical criminal. In neither case are the Pyrphorians still in evidence - you will have to ask one of the respective proprietors.</Text>
  <Text ID="801737">Go to the church and ask the Priest for help</Text>
  <Text ID="801738">&lt;b&gt;None better than the priest&lt;/b&gt;, hidden in shadow, witness to every confession, to guide you. "Yes, the rogues were here, but they are gone now, I am powerless to stop them, like everyone else." He tells how darkness grips the Montoyan community, and their suffering pours always through his doors— a last refuge for the holy. "Many speak of a ranch, the one a little way up the valley, and a beacon, some infernal eye, that holds their wicked congregation rapt," he says. You realise if that contract is anywhere, it is probably there.</Text>
  <Text ID="801739">&lt;b&gt;Your crew must trust themselves to the man of god.&lt;/b&gt; After all, he seems devoted to helping you cleanse Montoya of heresy. "No, I have not seen them," he begins, "but many of my flock have lately confessed their fears— their lost faith." He smiles blithely, and leads you from the church to &lt;b&gt;a decrepit warehouse on the dock&lt;/b&gt;. "If you too wish to rid yourself of your demons, I encourage yout to begin here." Now forgive me, for I cannot abide violence," he says, taking his leave. You can try to break the warehouse door, or you can sneak around the back.</Text>
  <Text ID="801740">Go to the den of ill-repute and ask the Madam for help</Text>
  <Text ID="801741">&lt;b&gt;The Madam is only too happy to help following such charming propitiations.&lt;/b&gt; "Yes, the devils were here. They always are." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning— The oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Mildly troubled, you set out for the ranch. </Text>
  <Text ID="801742">&lt;b&gt;The Madam refuses to help without payment.&lt;/b&gt; Time is money, and your mumbling mummers are wasting it.</Text>
  <Text ID="801743">Spend some time in the establishment</Text>
  <Text ID="801744">&lt;b&gt;All are commendably well-behaved.&lt;/b&gt; Your sailors make surprisingly good companions, all paying what they owe. "Now that I have some evidence as to your good character," says the Madam, "I will help you." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning— The oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a grotesque brand on her skin. Thanking her for her hospitality, you set out for the ranch. </Text>
  <Text ID="801745">&lt;b&gt;After an hour your sailors are all over the place&lt;/b&gt;, singing and carousing, one refusing to pay for services rendered. "Get them out!" screams the Madam. "But what of the information you promised?", "Out!". You have created enough of a scene. Fortunately two boys waiting outside cheerily agree to help you for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from they claim eerie sounds emanate at night, in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs." The door to the warehouse looks breakable.</Text>
  <Text ID="801746">Threaten her</Text>
  <Text ID="801747">&lt;b&gt;"Alright, Alright," she says bitterly&lt;/b&gt;, "Yes, the devils were here. They always are." She leads you through a lanterned garden of red dahlia, and points you up the valley to a ranch. "The sort of eye you seek is up there, at the casona," she clutches her wrist suddenly, "searing, burning... the oculus." Lifting her hand she reveals a brand on her skin. Feeling vaguely guilty for adding to the poor woman's woes, you set out for the ranch. </Text>
  <Text ID="801748">&lt;b&gt;She becomes strangely compliant&lt;/b&gt;, as if she is used to  empty aggression. "This way," she says with forced sensuality. She takes you backwards over your own steps to the dock, and gestures a silked sleeve (from which no hand protrudes) &lt;b&gt;to a decrepit-looking warehouse&lt;/b&gt;. "There. I must leave you now." The warehouse door looks breakable.</Text>
  <Text ID="801749">&lt;b&gt;There is no sign of the Pyrphorians&lt;/b&gt;, at least not that any of your twits see. Giving up their search, they begin stopping locals in the street. Most shake them off and walk on in a hurry. But they finally seem to strike lucky when two boys cheerily agree to help for a bit of coin. They lead your band &lt;b&gt;to a warehouse&lt;/b&gt; from which they claim eerie sounds emanate at night, in their words, like "stakes being driven through the hearts of vampyrs." The door to the warehouse looks breakable.</Text>
  <Text ID="801808">The House of Pyr</Text>
  <Text ID="801753">&lt;b&gt;The Prosperity contract must be here.&lt;/b&gt; The Casona looks quite modern, with its white walls and pleasant gables. There is even an adjoining orangery, that extends naturally towards the neat parterres of a sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, and long lines of equally white picket border the acreage in typically colonial style. Indeed were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at intervals— armed guards no doubt stationed in each— it would appear much as any other estate. You consider your plan of entry.</Text>
  <Text ID="801754">Play it bold, launching an assault on the house</Text>
  <Text ID="801755">&lt;b&gt;The guards at the main gate are efficiently dispatched&lt;/b&gt;, and their keys are taken. Your brigade flood into the ranch in formation, taking cover behind hedge and shrubbery, as the scattered enemy attempts to muster. Sure enough the robes begin to flow, and the petit pistols are out.  </Text>
  <Text ID="801756">Persist with a frontal assault</Text>
  <Text ID="801757">&lt;b&gt;The Pyrphorian defence is short-lived&lt;/b&gt;, and your  lose no-one. Leaving the dying Pyrphorians to bask in last light, you enter the house by the front door. &lt;br/&gt;Your party meet with no resistance in the vestibule, only dread. It is a large open room, with stairs at either side. A series of Pre-Raphaelite panels depicting Pyr the fire mother adorn the walls. In one, she stands beneath a dark and cosmic sky, disciples at her feet, each holding a braid of her flaming hair. The most striking feature of the room however, is the dome in the centre, which from below appears at first convex, and is painted in every detail as a human eye. The Oculus. A pinprick of sunlight falls from its pupil to an ominous platform, thick with ash. &lt;b&gt;You cannot find that contract soon enough.&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="801758">&lt;b&gt;Not as easy as your brigade presumes.&lt;/b&gt; There is strong resistance from the enemy, who in spite of their numinous attire, are well-armed.

  <Text ID="801762">&lt;b&gt;The guards at the main gate prove challenge enough already.&lt;/b&gt; Finally getting the better of them, your brigade see horses flood through the garden from the stables. Some are masked, others hired hands equipped with bandoliers. Even the gardeners have downed tools and pulled pistols. This is going to be rougher than you thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="801763">Draw the enemy out, so you can flank them</Text>
  <Text ID="801764">Marathon battle style. It works, the guards are defeated. A few sailors are injured but now the road to the house is open.&lt;br/&gt;Inside the house, which room to look for?</Text>
  <Text ID="801765">&lt;b&gt;Your strategy is too clever for your forces&lt;/b&gt;, who despite outnumbering the Pyrphorians three-to-one, are marginal victors.

  <Text ID="801770">&lt;b&gt;Your able scout climbs the fence&lt;/b&gt;, darting nimbly between flowerbeds, and under the broad umbrella of a royal poinciana, red as blood. The kitchen door on the east side is unguarded, but &lt;b&gt;locked, what will you have them do?&lt;/b&gt;</Text>
  <Text ID="801771">Knock through the glass with a sword hilt to turn the handle</Text>

  <Text ID="801903">The Investigation</Text>
  <Text ID="801904">Discouraged, the crew is forced to return to Isabel's island. "We lost them" apologises the captain. But a few days later, Isabel receives a letter from one of her scouting parties, 'Pyrphorian vessel spotted entering Montoya harbour." With renewed hope, the crew prepares to leave at once. &lt;b&gt;The contract and those Pyrphorians must be here in Montoya, but where?&lt;/b&gt; The city sprawls before you under a pastel blue sky, the distinctive whitewall and terracotta of Imperial La Corona glowing softly all along the narrow estuary where the Mixcoatl meets the ocean. Yet, tranquil it is not. Anxiety is written in every passing face. They must know who you are and what you seek, but finding one brave enough to share is a different matter. You can ask around, or rely instead on your own eyes to find clues.</Text>
  <Text ID="801942">The Infiltration</Text>
  <Text ID="801943">The sole survivor succeeds in getting back to Isabel's island. In his panic, he explains that the rest didn't make it, and describes how he traced the enemy back to an estate outside Montoya. A crew is assembled at once. They arrive to find the Casona looks quite modern, with its white walls and pleasant gables. &lt;b&gt;The Prosperity contract must be here.&lt;/b&gt; An adjoining orangery extends naturally towards the neat parterres of a sweet-smelling garden. An arc of white gravel serves as a drive, and long lines of equally white picket border the acreage in typical colonial style. Indeed were it not for the unusual height of this perimeter, and the shelters abutting it at intervals— armed guards no doubt stationed in each— it would appear much as any other estate. You consider your plan of entry.</Text>
  <Text ID="801899">You finally have your hands on the Prosperity contract! Now there's a chance of clearing your father's name, and by so doing, preventing the outbreak of war between Isabel Sarmento and the Queen.</Text>

  <Text ID="257000">Every time I ask Archie, I fear his insides combust.</Text>
  <Text ID="257001">The best thing is, dear old Archie never need know.</Text>
  <Text ID="257002">When a Queen asks you to do something…</Text>
  <Text ID="257003">I'm issuing you a royal decree.</Text>
  <Text ID="257004">I am the Queen after all.</Text>
  <Text ID="257005">Yes, I jolly well think you will accept.</Text>
  <Text ID="257006">Bon Voyage, as it is the fashion to say.</Text>
  <Text ID="257007">Well done, you have my tender affections!</Text>
  <Text ID="257008">I think we've both earned tea and a slice of sponge cake.</Text>
  <Text ID="257009">What a daring young one you are!</Text>
  <Text ID="257026">What gallantry! Though not quite worth a medal.</Text>
  <Text ID="257027">As reliable as my guards with the funny hats.</Text>
  <Text ID="257010">I was an obstinate child, and as such can empathise.</Text>
  <Text ID="257011">And there was I believing I'd found a loyal dachsund.</Text>
  <Text ID="257012">Need I tell you that you desert your nation!</Text>
  <Text ID="257013">Like my coronation, a farce from beginning to end.</Text>
  <Text ID="257014">My father would have had your head!</Text>
  <Text ID="257015">Don't be afraid to hurry, we are happy to wait!</Text>
  <Text ID="257016">Queens usually like things done quickly.</Text>
  <Text ID="257017">At least bring me some tea if nothing else!</Text>
  <Text ID="257018">You have served your Queen well, will you serve her again?</Text>
  <Text ID="257019">It is a trying time for the Empire, and we need you yet...</Text>
  <Text ID="257020">Your support is a comfort we would much like to continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="257021">Who could possibly be more important than your Queen?</Text>
  <Text ID="257022">I have not left the Palace in haste to be denied!</Text>
  <Text ID="257023">Have you succeeded in your mission?</Text>
  <Text ID="257024">Has my loyal subject returned?</Text>
  <Text ID="257025">I am told you may have something for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="257247">I'll call upon you, subject, if I need you.</Text>
  <Text ID="257248">There's nothing to keep you occupied here but my puppies.</Text>
  <Text ID="257249">Dear Archie has everything under control.</Text>
  <Text ID="266839">Oh do stop, Archie. Is this tiny fleet all I have to sink to get my island back?</Text>
  <Text ID="266840">Who are you, to speak up without permission?</Text>
  <Text ID="266841">So Edvard is the traitor! I certainly never authorised that silly-billy to act on my behalf. I declare the contract null and void.</Text>
  <Text ID="266842">Then I suppose we'll not be sinking any ships today. Not even as a deterrent?</Text>
  <Text ID="266843">Well in that case I hereby declare Prosperity returned to the Goode children— to compensate the dead father, thereby ensuring Miss Sarmento and co. are safe from this Pyrphorian nuisance.</Text>
  <Text ID="266966">What is that tinseled marionette talking about, Archie? We are safe here, aren't we?</Text>
  <Text ID="266987">Look at all those subjects! How enthusiastic they seem! Do you think they celebrate me, their royal highness?</Text>
  <Text ID="266988">And you are absolutely sure this Samuel Goode was innocent?</Text>
  <Text ID="266989">Let's heal it then, and be off.</Text>
  <Text ID="266990">My sincerest condolences, children of Samuel. For the loss of the father you loved, and for the tragedy caused by the unfortunate actions of your uncle.</Text>
  <Text ID="266991">For your unquestionable loyalty and bravery you shall be knighted, and bequeathed the island of Bright Sands from now and forevermore!</Text>
  <Text ID="266992">Hahaha... Forgive me, I always laugh at funerals!</Text>
  <Text ID="267144">But another tiresome prophet of doom, Archie. How dreary!</Text>
  <Text ID="267435">These rebels, whoever they are, will pay the penalty for challenging my sovereignty!</Text>
  <Text ID="267449">The time has come to take that territory back by force.</Text>
  <Text ID="267450">Funny ending a war over a bit of paper!</Text>
  <Text ID="267451">I must admit, I am too fond of my sailors.</Text>
  <Text ID="267452">I understand this means the end of a rebellion on the island, very good.</Text>
  <Text ID="267453">So is it Isabel who is nice, or the Pyrphorians?</Text>
  <Text ID="267454">As long as we have Prosperity back, that business with your father can be forgotten.</Text>
  <Text ID="267455">So Edvard was the nasty one, and Samuel was the one with dandruff?</Text>
  <Text ID="267456">Fancy forging a signature. People can be terrible can't they?</Text>
  <Text ID="267457">I'm surprised that Isabel gave it back without a fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="267632">Once built, your Court of Justice shall inaugurate a new era of peace and prosperity for Empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="267642">This trial should be a celebration! A toast to all things civilised.</Text>
  <Text ID="267643">I don't normally attend trials so this one must be important.</Text>
  <Text ID="267644">You now own the highest court in the land!</Text>
  <Text ID="267645">The Court of Justice, magnificent!</Text>
  <Text ID="267646">Is the Court of Justice finished yet? Not quite?</Text>
  <Text ID="267647">I can't wait to play judge and give the gavel a sharp tap!</Text>
  <Text ID="267648">Did Archie tell you I planned to visit? I hope there's a convenient mooring for my flagship. I don't like long walks.</Text>
  <Text ID="267649">Treat me as you would any other guest.</Text>
  <Text ID="267650">Just so you know, I am not fond of garlic or profiteroles.</Text>
  <Text ID="267651">One approves! And it is nice to get out and about.</Text>
  <Text ID="267652">It all sounds very cheery so far. Make it cheerier.</Text>
  <Text ID="267653">Mind you, I do like it when things are special. You can do special?</Text>
  <Text ID="267654">May I express my gratitude for your sterling work preserving peace on the continent?</Text>
  <Text ID="267655">So this is the funny little island that's hosting the trial! Jolly good.</Text>
  <Text ID="267656">Now I'm here, I am of course impatient for the trial to begin.</Text>
  <Text ID="267657">A modern Queen must show she is able to dispense mercy. The man must be given fair hearing.</Text>
  <Text ID="267658">Where are all the witnesses?</Text>
  <Text ID="267659">Now we are finally all present, let this long overdue trial commence!</Text>
  <Text ID="267660">And where's the defendant?</Text>
  <Text ID="267772">This is all rather unusual. We are safe here?</Text>
  <Text ID="267792">This is unexpected. You are taking care of those beastly malefactors?</Text>
  <Text ID="267793">A few angry hoodlums can't overthrow an Empire, can they?</Text>
  <Text ID="267794">I thought they must be after fame or riches, but they want to kill me.</Text>
  <Text ID="267795">I wonder what has become of the royal fleet…</Text>
  <Text ID="267796">Tell me they are not attacking this island? The one we are on?</Text>
  <Text ID="267797">I surrender myself wholly to your security arrangements.</Text>
  <Text ID="267798">I suppose then, my safety is in your hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="267800">When we get out of this I promise you a whole duchy. Although, no, I can't actually promise that.</Text>
  <Text ID="267801">We are so happy to be finally allowed to leave this island. And for your heroism of course.</Text>
  <Text ID="267802">Under different circumstances, you might have called it a pleasant visit!</Text>
  <Text ID="267803">I'm sure we can make Isabel's tiny little chunk a protectorate of some sort.</Text>
  <Text ID="259872">It makes one feel frisky and alive!</Text>
  <Text ID="259873">We ARE amused!</Text>
  <Text ID="259874">This suits us very well.</Text>
  <Text ID="259875">How wonderful to have it our own way!</Text>
  <Text ID="259876">How mischievous one feels!</Text>
  <Text ID="259877">It has all gone off very satisfactorily!</Text>
  <Text ID="259878">All is much as it should be.</Text>
  <Text ID="259879">Be strong in business, and become a pillar of our nation.</Text>
  <Text ID="259880">You continue to be of the greatest use to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="259881">Your successes must be a source of pride.</Text>
  <Text ID="259882">We appreciate your efforts.</Text>
  <Text ID="259883">Parliament commends you exceedingly.</Text>
  <Text ID="259884">You slide easily about the board like the rook!</Text>
  <Text ID="259885">You are a very able servant of the realm.</Text>
  <Text ID="259886">We are not amused!</Text>
  <Text ID="259887">The Queen regrets this distressing affair.</Text>
  <Text ID="259888">Another Queen may have turned to execution by now.</Text>
  <Text ID="259889">It is gravely injurious to our nation.</Text>
  <Text ID="259890">One wants prompt action against such outrage.</Text>
  <Text ID="259891">It is a time of discord for those of my station.</Text>
  <Text ID="259892">One of the many threats to my position.</Text>
  <Text ID="259893">The Queen finds your conduct inexcusable!</Text>
  <Text ID="259894">My father would have had you executed!</Text>
  <Text ID="259895">You WILL do better!</Text>
  <Text ID="259896">What a perilously selfish subject you are!</Text>
  <Text ID="259897">Your Queen is displeased with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259898">Parliament will discuss what shall be done with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259899">Tantamount to treason!</Text>
  <Text ID="257028">If it please an all-powerful deity to place me on the throne, it shall certainly please you...</Text>
  <Text ID="257030">I am your Queen. What further introduction is needed?</Text>
  <Text ID="257029">Have you met Nelson? Why he's a chestnut stallion with an arabian head.</Text>
  <Text ID="257031">'Oh pooh to "your highness", call me ma'am.</Text>
  <Text ID="257032">I was beginning to enjoy being alone for once.</Text>
  <Text ID="257033">I long for some gaiety - a play or an opera.</Text>
  <Text ID="257034">I am fond of pleasant society, are you that?</Text>
  <Text ID="257035">No interruption fatigues, if it benefits the nation.</Text>
  <Text ID="257036">The dogs bite traitors and loyal alike, so they aren't much help.</Text>
  <Text ID="260946">A discretionary fleet for national emergencies.</Text>
  <Text ID="260947">I want to be a spearhead not a figurehead.</Text>
  <Text ID="260948">We do not solicit violence, yet under my rule it seems as constant as the crashing waves.</Text>
  <Text ID="260949">I do not forget the sacrifice of these sailors on my account.</Text>
  <Text ID="259900">Then we owe our gratitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="259901">It is much admired.</Text>
  <Text ID="259902">Sincere thanks for attending to this matter.</Text>
  <Text ID="259903">It would be prudent to accept.</Text>
  <Text ID="259904">Oh, we are only too happy to agree.</Text>
  <Text ID="259905">We shall be delighted.</Text>
  <Text ID="261073">Apparently my father disliked babies. I think I shall be as decisive, but slightly less mad.</Text>
  <Text ID="261075">It doesn't matter what you think of me, it is what I think of you.</Text>
  <Text ID="261076">Archie has been like a father to me, his company fills me with all those paternal hopes and comforts.</Text>
  <Text ID="261077">Archie never stops me eating jam, and will suffer the subsequent indigestion for me too!</Text>
  <Text ID="261078">If not for Archie, the rest would still be leading me up and down stairs like an infant.</Text>
  <Text ID="261074">Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow, is a respected voice on the Royal Council.</Text>
  <Text ID="261079">Sarmento is a strong woman, let us hope she keeps no secrets from us.</Text>
  <Text ID="261080">Anne Harlow must know that no injustice can excuse her own crimes.</Text>
  <Text ID="261081">Jean La Fortune is a pirate whose name I too-commonly hear.</Text>
  <Text ID="261082">The council has agreed my prison reforms, so I hope Mr. Bleakworth will bend a little.</Text>
  <Text ID="261083">Miss Jorgensen is a distant relative. Although my relatives are all quite distant.</Text>
  <Text ID="261084">I understand we have visiting royalty in Princess Qing. She's a gentle soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="261085">Willie Wibblesock? A made-up name surely?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261086">It's Mr von Malching. I will never offer that awful man a barony.</Text>
  <Text ID="261088">The presence of Vicente Silva is clearly an attempt by La Corona to challenge my authority here.</Text>
  <Text ID="259906">Shame Queens can't chop heads anymore.</Text>
  <Text ID="259907">Heaven forbid!</Text>
  <Text ID="259908">If that is a joke, it is not a funny one.</Text>
  <Text ID="250673">Time to hoist your suspenders, and thrust into the unknown!</Text>
  <Text ID="250674">If you pop off now, you'll be back in time for tennis!</Text>
  <Text ID="250675">Know that any assistance may influence Her Majesty's sphere!</Text>
  <Text ID="250676">Alas, my bowels churn afresh and I must beg your expertise...</Text>
  <Text ID="250677">Now here is a vital matter, of Queen and country!</Text>
  <Text ID="250680">Righty-ho!</Text>
  <Text ID="250681">Jolly Roger!</Text>
  <Text ID="250682">Buckaroo!</Text>
  <Text ID="250683">That really is first-rate.</Text>
  <Text ID="250684">I am quite penetrated by your kindness.</Text>
  <Text ID="250685">Bish-bang-bibbly, there she blows!</Text>
  <Text ID="250686">Ideally, one should keep one's promises.</Text>
  <Text ID="250687">Now, now. You oughtn't to waste people's time.</Text>
  <Text ID="250688">Didn't finish? Ah. Um…hmmn…</Text>
  <Text ID="250689">Failed? I feel a ghastly surge coming on.</Text>
  <Text ID="250690">Caught trousers down? Happens to the best of us!</Text>
  <Text ID="250708">Her Majesty has little patience, I'd skip to it if I were you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250709">Have you heard the expression, 'a stitch in time saves nine' …</Text>
  <Text ID="250710">Resting? Perhaps you'd like my latest; male torso in rosewood!</Text>
  <Text ID="250711">Much has moved since we spoke, but I can still count on you?</Text>
  <Text ID="250712">I fear I must call upon you again, in spite of your good work.</Text>
  <Text ID="250713">I confess these unseemly troubles gurgle on, hope you don't mind? </Text>
  <Text ID="250714">Loyalty to the crown really should come above all else …</Text>
  <Text ID="250715">Only Her Majesty has your best interests at heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="254725">Oh, you're ready?</Text>
  <Text ID="254726">Had a rip-roaring time of it?</Text>
  <Text ID="254727">Brought some joy?</Text>
  <Text ID="257203">Nothing just now, but we value your eagerness!</Text>
  <Text ID="257204">If you return a little later, I may have something…</Text>
  <Text ID="257205">Pop back another time, and I'll fill your stocking.</Text>
  <Text ID="257206">Apart from security, I appreciate the company!</Text>
  <Text ID="257207">Two's the charm!</Text>
  <Text ID="257208">Well well, chosen for a royal escort!</Text>
  <Text ID="250435">I'm here if ever you need a steady, albeit somewhat arthritic, hand to guide you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250436">How could you not select old Archie? Her Majesty's moist mouthpiece! </Text>
  <Text ID="250437">One-piece underwear suits? Too prickly! I find singleton shorts and vests to be tried and true!</Text>
  <Text ID="250479">Weird and wonderful!</Text>
  <Text ID="250482">I'm sure ma'am shall be delighted!</Text>
  <Text ID="250483">Superlative!</Text>
  <Text ID="250484">Suitably regal!</Text>
  <Text ID="250485">Her Majesty's might approve!</Text>
  <Text ID="250486">Comforting as a moist and springy sponge!</Text>
  <Text ID="250487">Well that certainly settles the stomach!</Text>
  <Text ID="250489">You're a credit to the Empire!</Text>
  <Text ID="250490">You're constant, and that is key!</Text>
  <Text ID="250491">Perhaps a peerage is on the cards?</Text>
  <Text ID="250492">Majesty will soon be mentioning you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250493">I knew you'd come through!</Text>
  <Text ID="250494">You're flourishing!</Text>
  <Text ID="250495">You're a national treasure!</Text>
  <Text ID="250496">Her Majesty will be discomfited…</Text>
  <Text ID="250497">There's an unpleasant waft in the air.</Text>
  <Text ID="250498">Heavens, what shall I tell her majesty?</Text>
  <Text ID="250499">Oh, horsefeathers.</Text>
  <Text ID="250500">This brings on my indigestion.</Text>
  <Text ID="250501">I'm suddenly hot under the collar.</Text>
  <Text ID="250502">Pshaw, I shan't sleep at all. </Text>
  <Text ID="250503">You put me in a difficult position…</Text>
  <Text ID="250504">I wouldn't wish to accuse you of disloyalty… </Text>
  <Text ID="250505">Perhaps think again on the situation? </Text>
  <Text ID="250506">I fear you've made things awkward…</Text>
  <Text ID="250507">Might I advise against your current course?</Text>
  <Text ID="250508">Now we don't want to have a contretemps.</Text>
  <Text ID="250509">It's not that we don't trust you entirely…</Text>
  <Text ID="250511">I present my humble duty to you, and am confident you'll transcend your present circumstance! </Text>
  <Text ID="250512">I am a humble servant of Her Majesty, called upon for delicate occasions such as these.</Text>
  <Text ID="250513">Taking the initiative - excellent!</Text>
  <Text ID="250514">What a jolly jolly surprise.</Text>
  <Text ID="250515">Ah yes, the bright young sapling!</Text>
  <Text ID="250516">I present my humble duty to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250517">Don't tell me I've missed another appointment?</Text>
  <Text ID="250518">Sir Archibald Blake, how may I serve?</Text>
  <Text ID="250519">Anyone for croquet?</Text>
  <Text ID="250541">We prepare for the worst but hope for the best.</Text>
  <Text ID="250542">Our humble little Empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="250543">The King is dead, long live the Queen!</Text>
  <Text ID="250544">The street layout was positively Byzantine until recent times.</Text>
  <Text ID="250546">Her Majesty's finest!</Text>
  <Text ID="250547">A lustrous jewel in the crown!</Text>
  <Text ID="250548">Every ship needs a stiff rudder!</Text>
  <Text ID="250549">An Empire covers both land AND sea!</Text>
  <Text ID="250550">Ma'am and I are much obliged!</Text>
  <Text ID="250551">A royal acknowledgement is due!</Text>
  <Text ID="250552">Sir Archibald gives his thanks.</Text>
  <Text ID="250553">Naturally!</Text>
  <Text ID="250557">But of course!</Text>
  <Text ID="250559">Oh, most assuredly!</Text>
  <Text ID="250593">I fear that may be impossible.</Text>
  <Text ID="250594">The thought makes me wince!</Text>
  <Text ID="250595">Oh my aching organs, no.</Text>
  <Text ID="250596">As a boy, I was chased through the palace by a disgruntled goose, honking and hissing! I had its egg, you see. Once I'd given it back, the goose and I became firm friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="250597">Tolerance, sympathy, understanding. Supreme qualities in a monarch wishing for a happy reign.</Text>
  <Text ID="250598">Her Majesty rarely needs guidance - ah, a little here and there - I think she simply likes to have my company.</Text>
  <Text ID="250599">Ever carved a lovespoon from walnut? I did have an amour once, but matters of state drew us apart.</Text>
  <Text ID="250600">As Her Majesty's adjutant, I must be quietly attentive. The merest smile on her face is enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="250601">Viscount Guffington-Hawkmoth, wounded at his own estate. It brings to light Her Majesty's very present vulnerability.</Text>
  <Text ID="250602">Bless Her Majesty, she eats so fast, but when she stops, so must we!</Text>
  <Text ID="250605">Her Majesty's rare gift is a soft heart and a hard mind. With monarchs, it is too often the reverse!</Text>
  <Text ID="250606">Anne Harlow's fall from grace was stormy and unpleasant, a bit like my bowels.</Text>
  <Text ID="250607">George Smith has a marvellous walking cane of alder, with tasteful silver flourishes.</Text>
  <Text ID="250608">Aha...Jean La Fortune. We'd like to have helped, but it's rather gone beyond that now. </Text>
  <Text ID="250609">Isabel Sarmento? You should probably be careful where you speak that name.</Text>
  <Text ID="250610">Mr. Bleakworth may seem a blinkered horse, but is very well-suited to his task at the prison. So much so, I wonder if he takes his own conviction in the penal sense!</Text>
  <Text ID="250611">When running errands for Her Majesty, I often find myself in Madame Kahina's exquisite company.</Text>
  <Text ID="250612">Miss Jorgensen is a far relation of Her Majesty, if I'm not mistaken. They do both share a certain boldness...</Text>
  <Text ID="250613">We have made every conceivable dispensation for Pincess Qing, as we are compelled do with visiting royalty!</Text>
  <Text ID="250614">We auditioned this Wibblesock for Her Majesty's fifteenth birthday, sadly the rabbit didn't survive the hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="250615">Beryl O'Mara has flies on the wall, as I only dream our own discrete services might.</Text>
  <Text ID="250616">Her Majesty wearies of Mr. von Malching's pinguid claims to a non-existent barony. </Text>
  <Text ID="250617">I worry Artur Gasparov might one day appear at the palace better-dressed than her majesty. </Text>
  <Text ID="250666">Pure pleasure …</Text>
  <Text ID="250667">All in Her Majesty's name.</Text>
  <Text ID="250668">More flexible than you imagined!</Text>
  <Text ID="250669">The royal seal upon it!</Text>
  <Text ID="250670">I can finally let go that pent-up gas!</Text>
  <Text ID="250671">Customs and excise, eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="250672">Duty done, time for a kip!</Text>
  <Text ID="256682">Oh dear, lost your flagship? Well, I'll see what I can rustle up...</Text>
  <Text ID="261188">We can't deny it's a difficult time. The sale of Prosperity was highly destabilising for Her Majesty. </Text>
  <Text ID="265026">Debt free? Spiffing, just the dib-dab. One splendid licence we shall draw up forthwith. </Text>
  <Text ID="265027">As to the debt my hands are tied, but it may warm her majesty's heart to see a new enterprise taking shape. </Text>
  <Text ID="265028">Did he really…? Oh dear, best leave these poor people with me. I will tell Edvard that the debt between you is quite settled…</Text>
  <Text ID="265061">What is it you are bringing?</Text>
  <Text ID="266751">I will let Edvard know that I have granted you your shipping licence.</Text>
  <Text ID="266752">We also hear on the grapevine, of your commendable intention to establish your own shipping company…</Text>
  <Text ID="266753">Her Majesty warmly invites you to trade in sovereign harbours, at your own discretion of course.</Text>
  <Text ID="266199">So you build ships like your father? Well, the Queen is in the direst need of ships.</Text>
  <Text ID="266200">Supporting her will go some way to healing the wounds of the past. </Text>
  <Text ID="266201">These reinforcements will please Her Majesty! Though it remains my hope no war will be necessary.</Text>
  <Text ID="266809">I read in the papers you build ships like your father. His actions have likely led to war, so it would be strangely fitting if you were to supply the Queen's fleet.</Text>
  <Text ID="266810">You are doing Her Majesty a great service in these difficult times.</Text>
  <Text ID="266811">How are those ships coming along? Her Majesty will be pleased.</Text>
  <Text ID="266812">Her Majesty wants only warships. It is after all important in such times, that she defends her sovereignty.</Text>
  <Text ID="266813">We rely more and more on captains of industry to steer us to happy futures.</Text>
  <Text ID="266261">This symbol is a death threat?! But - Her Majesty received one identical! Upon a plain envelope, with a stamp from the colonies!</Text>
  <Text ID="266262">We still don't know how your father was involved in all this, but I fear the answer lies west.</Text>
  <Text ID="266263">Your father sold Prosperity to the leader of the rebels Isabel Sarmento.</Text>
  <Text ID="266933">The sale of Prosperity, made in  Samuel's name, has weakened Her Majesty's position greatly.</Text>
  <Text ID="266264">Ever since the deal, Isabel has been hiding from us. But you may be the one to find her.</Text>
  <Text ID="266926">After the excellent work you are doing for the fleet, I think you're entitled to pursue the odd personal matter.</Text>
  <Text ID="266931">I wish as much as you that your father were innocent in this.</Text>
  <Text ID="266932">Those very serious accusations against your father are hard to dismiss without proof to the contrary.</Text>
  <Text ID="266934">You digging around in state matters isn’t ideal, but in this case may be necessary.</Text>
  <Text ID="266935">That these "Pyrphorians" may have spread their influence in the New World is grave news indeed. </Text>
  <Text ID="266936">The situation closer to home is already difficult. Her Majesty has come under increasing scrutiny from many sides.</Text>
  <Text ID="266937">Her Majesty may go to war with Isabel. That is why she is mustering a fleet.</Text>
  <Text ID="266938">Isabel will be cagey, but I think she with time she may listen to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="266939">Isabel may not trust you to begin with - but remember, neither did I!</Text>
  <Text ID="266940">You may find Isabel fiercely independent. But I trust in you to bring her round.</Text>
  <Text ID="266941">I fear Her Majesty will not care to know the difference between these Pyrphorians and the local rebellion. So we'll have to leave that to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266942">I wish you the best, for Queen and country!</Text>
  <Text ID="268092">Her Majesty is on edge. You'd better keep things ticking along with Isabel.</Text>
  <Text ID="268091">However Prosperity fell into the wrong hands, it really needs to be set right before Her Majesty sends the fleet.</Text>
  <Text ID="268090">The Queen really is ready to do something drastic. We don't have a lot of leeway.</Text>
  <Text ID="268089">Do not underestimate the efficiency of the Pyrphorian machine. Wheels no doubt turn turn as we speak.</Text>
  <Text ID="268088">Her Majesty wants Prosperity back. By whatever means necessary...</Text>
  <Text ID="268087">Prosperity was our key to unlock the region. The Empire stands to lose greatly from that deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="268086">We have little influence in new world waters now, you are the one diplomatic weapon we have.</Text>
  <Text ID="268085">Most of us want a peaceful conclusion from this Prosperity business.</Text>
  <Text ID="267367">Her Majesty will soon go to war with Isabel over Prosperity. Any other solution would be preferable.</Text>
  <Text ID="267389">You would be doing a great service for Queen and country.</Text>
  <Text ID="267390">With that document we can still reverse the original deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="267391">Then Edvard did sell Prosperity. I didn't want to believe it, but I had my suspicions.</Text>
  <Text ID="267392">Her Majesty is very quick on the trigger. We must some how avoid her coming to blows.</Text>
  <Text ID="267393">Her Majesty will soon arrive aboard her charger, sword aloft.</Text>
  <Text ID="267394">You have averted war most delicately! Her Majesty may thank you, in time.</Text>
  <Text ID="267395">Good, but there's little time. Her Majesty has her campaign chart out on the table!</Text>
  <Text ID="267396">A whole nation is behind you, though they do not know it.</Text>
  <Text ID="267397">Our Empire is spread too thin to countenance another war at this time.</Text>
  <Text ID="267398">Now war has averted, an alliance with Isabel might even be of mutual benefit…</Text>
  <Text ID="267399">With the Pyrphorian presence on Prosperity neutralised, the island can be freely returned to its rightful keeper.</Text>
  <Text ID="267400">The Pyrphorians will no doubt regroup elsewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="267401">Isabel needn't be an enemy to us, now Prosperity is back in safe hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="267605">I think it's better you break the bad news to Edvard. Let him know his gambit is over.</Text>
  <Text ID="267619">A terrible business. Edvard must be put now to trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267620">It has been decided that you shall construct a new Court of Justice for the purposes of Edvard's trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267621">As saviour in the New World, Her Majesty agrees that you should host this prestigious trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267622">It is fitting that a new crown court be erected upon family soil for the trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267623">Just like your justice building, the case against Edvard is beginning to gather momentum.</Text>
  <Text ID="267624">Her Majesty has been ever so much looking forward to seeing her new Court of Justice. I hope you'll be ready.</Text>
  <Text ID="267625">Her Majesty is itching to visit! Have your best curtsey ready!</Text>
  <Text ID="267626">I hardly dare interrupt the miraculous transformation of your island, but Her Majesty is rather keen to get on with things.</Text>
  <Text ID="267627">This could be a good opportunity for Isabel Sarmento to come forward as a witness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267628">I think we have built up enough trust with Isabel to rely on her as a witness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267629">Her majesty was remarkably tolerant of the idea of Sarmento as a witness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267630">When it comes to the Pyrphorians, there's still a lot we don't know.</Text>
  <Text ID="267631">The Queen has taken a great interest in this trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267805">The Pyrphorians must fall or civilisation will!</Text>
  <Text ID="267819">Under no circumstances must the Queen's safety be compromised!</Text>
  <Text ID="267820">You have won the day!</Text>
  <Text ID="267821">How shall I explain to her majesty, that we are under siege…</Text>
  <Text ID="267822">This must be the Pyrphorian mothership! </Text>
  <Text ID="267823">My giddy aunt, that is no normal naval craft!</Text>
  <Text ID="267824">Without supplies, I'm not absolutely sure we can hold out…</Text>
  <Text ID="267825">The Queen must be saved at all costs!</Text>
  <Text ID="267826">Those supplies could be crucial in gaining the upper hand over our foes.</Text>
  <Text ID="267827">Reinforcements incoming! Our royal supply ships must pass unscathed!</Text>
  <Text ID="267828">We cannot afford to lose many more supply ships to our foe.</Text>
  <Text ID="267829">Perhaps this will bring their ringleader out of the woodwork.</Text>
  <Text ID="267830">Such reinforcements are going to be vital.</Text>
  <Text ID="267831">The Queen is saved! All thanks to your remarkable travails and hardships!</Text>
  <Text ID="267832">The battle for Bright Sands will decide the fate of civilisation!</Text>
  <Text ID="267833">The ever-increasing roar from the street, will need a ruler as capable and wise as Her Majesty. </Text>
  <Text ID="266722">Abduction, is a severe accusation...</Text>
  <Text ID="266723">I see nothing criminal. A bit of interfamilial bickering is only natural, and hardly a matter for the crown.</Text>
  <Text ID="266724">And as for you, I have quite forgotten my manners. Sir Archibald Blake, ambassador and confidant to the Queen. Despite the circumstances, Her Majesty and I were pleased to hear of your return. Your father’s death was a tragedy; we regret he never had the chance of a fair trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="266725">Sadly your Uncle has indeed alerted me to some floating liabilities. I fear you have no choice but to settle them, if I am to grant you your crown shipping licence.</Text>
  <Text ID="266849">Isabel Sarmento, Her Royal Highness, The Queen requires you to give up your iniquitous seizure of Prosperity, an island which, by no means...</Text>
  <Text ID="266850">Er..this is one of the Goode children I mentioned. A little forward, but surprisingly helpful so far!</Text>
  <Text ID="266851">Terribly sorry, your Majesty, but I fear not.</Text>
  <Text ID="266971">As safe as the situation allows, highness.</Text>
  <Text ID="266972">Oh you are awfully right, old chum. I beseech you, we must protect Her Majesty at any cost!</Text>
  <Text ID="266993">In a manner of speaking, your Majesty, in a manner of speaking!</Text>
  <Text ID="266994">No doubt, your Majesty— mustn't worry. Your attendance at this ceremony is nothing short of sublime. A gesture of the uttermost nobility that can heal this tormented place.</Text>
  <Text ID="266995">I fear Majesty, it is time we were on our way...</Text>
  <Text ID="267145">Well, momentarily, at least! Mr. Edvard Goode, you are to be placed under house arrest in Bright Sands until the time of your trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="266482">Oh…there’s already someone out there!</Text>
  <Text ID="266483">How do you look? I’d presumed we would be fully rendered here…</Text>
  <Text ID="266484">Darnation! I always said this union business was a nonsense! And that we are to look shabby-chic because of it?! Whatever next, my dear Tanya? Shall we abandon it all?</Text>
  <Text ID="266485">"Not “Anno 1800 - The Musical"", then?!"</Text>
  <Text ID="266486">Er...I’m not sure if her Majesty would approve. Perhaps over tea at the palace we could discuss your designs and—</Text>
  <Text ID="266487">Oh dear Tanya, please can we stick to…</Text>
  <Text ID="266488">Equally as flat as you are.</Text>
  <Text ID="266489">But we are not in private! You are here in the role of Anno-A.I! Carl Leonard von Malching— ill-tempered industrialist!</Text>
  <Text ID="266490">One moment, her majesty has not arrived yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="266491">quite feeble and small</Text>
  <Text ID="266492">The magic lies in the checksum</Text>
  <Text ID="266493">We could never have dared hope you would participate in so irreverent a trifle.</Text>
  <Text ID="266494">To be honest, no…</Text>
  <Text ID="266495">No!</Text>
  <Text ID="266496">But the game is jolly boring. Half the time I’m asleep before anyone discovers my island!</Text>
  <Text ID="266497">When your ship / Has you snoring / When the waiting is boring / I click fast forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266498">Is my island warehouse bare? / Is that just too hard to bear? / then I fast forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266499">They all fast-forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266500">We fast forward, and forward…</Text>
  <Text ID="266501">I think the sun is burned-out.</Text>
  <Text ID="266502">You don’t recognise it? I jest not, this is how we looked in 1602.</Text>
  <Text ID="266503">Oh so true! It’s far too much blue!</Text>
  <Text ID="266504">Oh horror! Oh pain! / Who came up with this drunken idea!?</Text>
  <Text ID="266505">All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?</Text>
  <Text ID="266506">Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.</Text>
  <Text ID="255457">Buck up jellyfish…I promise I won't tell.</Text>
  <Text ID="255458">Let's see what you're good for, shall we?</Text>
  <Text ID="255459">I'll put you on trial, but be ready for the noose.</Text>
  <Text ID="255461">Ready to take a walk, sailor?</Text>
  <Text ID="255460">I've a part for you in my tragedy.</Text>
  <Text ID="255462">And cut a few throats on the way.</Text>
  <Text ID="255463">Brave. Very brave.</Text>
  <Text ID="255464">Shake the tree, see what falls.</Text>
  <Text ID="255465">You shall have a share, just like the rest of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="255466">Now we all get a piece.</Text>
  <Text ID="255467">Got away with it, this time.</Text>
  <Text ID="255470">None shall live who scorn the oath.</Text>
  <Text ID="255471">You're dead, milksop.</Text>
  <Text ID="255472">No prey, no pay.</Text>
  <Text ID="255473">The black spot be upon yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="255474">I don't forgive or forget.</Text>
  <Text ID="255475">I'll stick a breech-loader in yer breeches!</Text>
  <Text ID="255476">Fly the flag, or the flintlock goes up you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255477">Don't think you can hide ashore.</Text>
  <Text ID="255478">Climb back in the cannon lunkhead, the fuse is already lit!</Text>
  <Text ID="255479">Keep swimming, or you'll drown.</Text>
  <Text ID="255480">Hold out yer glass, lightweight.</Text>
  <Text ID="255481">Show you ain't a rotten royalist.</Text>
  <Text ID="255482">I guarantee you'll be fish bait.</Text>
  <Text ID="255483">Ready for your share?</Text>
  <Text ID="255484">Found yer prey?</Text>
  <Text ID="255485">Done the deed, 'ave yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="257212">Not yet! Watch for the sign. </Text>
  <Text ID="257213">Only come here when I need you or you'll regret it.</Text>
  <Text ID="257214">I don't need your help.</Text>
  <Text ID="257215">Prove yer worth at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="257216">Let's see what kind of landlubber we have eh boys?</Text>
  <Text ID="257217">Let's see if yer talk's as good as yer walk.</Text>
  <Text ID="261180">My father gave his life to his king. Your father gave his life to his Queen. Still they're never sated.</Text>
  <Text ID="261181">You'd fight the crown if you knew the truth, not crawl beneath it. </Text>
  <Text ID="267923">When it comes to murder, all roads lead to Rome.</Text>
  <Text ID="267924">So, you're the Queen's errand-boy.</Text>
  <Text ID="261182">Say hello to my old mate Jean won't yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="261183">My father never had the privilege of a trial. Your Queen's father near strung him up himself.</Text>
  <Text ID="266596">Why does everyone want a piece of the Queen now.</Text>
  <Text ID="266597">I'm sure I recognised something about that grandmaster.</Text>
  <Text ID="258453">Piracy's not dead then, not while Angry Annie's men lurk abroad. </Text>
  <Text ID="258454">Don't you dare smile, or I'll cut you a new one.</Text>
  <Text ID="258455">I give the orders matey, or you lose your coconut.</Text>
  <Text ID="258456">Death to the Queen! </Text>
  <Text ID="258457">Raise the Corsair cloth!</Text>
  <Text ID="258458">A rusty nail in the enemy's socket. </Text>
  <Text ID="258459">Three cheers for vengeance!</Text>
  <Text ID="258460">Disobey's a pretty way!</Text>
  <Text ID="258461">Soon they'll have nothing left. </Text>
  <Text ID="258462">No-one slights a Harlow. </Text>
  <Text ID="258463">I like people with a coarse air.</Text>
  <Text ID="258464">Lucky you, still with a head! </Text>
  <Text ID="258465">Should I scrub that mark from your name.</Text>
  <Text ID="258466">Aren't we a pair of pitiful souls.</Text>
  <Text ID="258467">I'd hang you. Take that as a compliment. </Text>
  <Text ID="258468">At least you're a bit rough round the fringes.</Text>
  <Text ID="258469">I'd almost believe you weren't a royalist.</Text>
  <Text ID="258470">For every head lost, I'll take ten more!</Text>
  <Text ID="258471">If I don't have my way, no-one else has theirs. </Text>
  <Text ID="258472">Life pricks us, do we not bleed?! </Text>
  <Text ID="258473">So what if I keep my own wounds green?</Text>
  <Text ID="258474">Hate is a bottomless cup that I pour and pour. </Text>
  <Text ID="258475">I'll die if that's what it takes. </Text>
  <Text ID="258476">Nothing can make it any worse…</Text>
  <Text ID="258477">Get in my way again, and I'll skewer you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258478">I'll strip out yer gizzard. </Text>
  <Text ID="258479">D'you take me for some dime novel damsel?! </Text>
  <Text ID="258480">I've got no problem slitting yer belly. </Text>
  <Text ID="258481">I've n'er seen flippers so limp as yours! </Text>
  <Text ID="258482">We'll spoon out your goggles like cockles. </Text>
  <Text ID="258483">We'll crush yer bones like hardtack biscuits.</Text>
  <Text ID="255394">Shake yer booty out of Angry Annie's waters or she'll blow a hole in yer mizzen. </Text>
  <Text ID="255395">Know what Annie does with royalists? We dunk you full o' fish.</Text>
  <Text ID="256852">If yer be no pirate, yer be prey. </Text>
  <Text ID="256870">Better hope you can hold yer own with a rapier.</Text>
  <Text ID="256871">Now why would you come 'ere?</Text>
  <Text ID="256872">So ye know, there'll be no stopping vengeance!</Text>
  <Text ID="256873">This one thinks they're a pirate lads.</Text>
  <Text ID="256874">You'll take a drop o' powder in your liquor.</Text>
  <Text ID="256875">I'll drink you under the table!</Text>
  <Text ID="260906">I'd rather count heads than have four-poster beds.</Text>
  <Text ID="260907">I don't need to dress like Pope Joan to rule these reprobates.</Text>
  <Text ID="260908">Yeah life here's miserable, spare me the requiem.</Text>
  <Text ID="260909">Father'd've hated to see me live like this, but I don't care.</Text>
  <Text ID="260910">Yeah, I stole this ship. Start as you mean to go on!</Text>
  <Text ID="260911">No coward man is Annie's match at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="260912">The ship it was their coffin, and their grave it was the sea</Text>
  <Text ID="260913">We pirates may not rule the waves, but we make them bloody choppy.</Text>
  <Text ID="258484">Expect me to be grateful?</Text>
  <Text ID="258485">Nothing can bring my father back.</Text>
  <Text ID="258486">What have I got to be thankful for?</Text>
  <Text ID="258487">Aye. </Text>
  <Text ID="258488">On their heads be it.</Text>
  <Text ID="258489">That's right and proper.</Text>
  <Text ID="261001">Proud to be exactly what my father wasn't - a traitor! God save the Queen!</Text>
  <Text ID="261002">A thousand privateers who would die to live, and me, who lives only to die.</Text>
  <Text ID="261003">We are wronged, all of us. The Empire shall feel the wrath of scimitar, spear and cutlass!</Text>
  <Text ID="261004">My whole house gone to hell, but for I, the last swish of its flaming tail.</Text>
  <Text ID="261005">If execution was good enough for my brother, it'll be good enough for Her Majesty.</Text>
  <Text ID="261006">Any pirate not flying my flag is a dead man - you hear me La Fortune?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261007">Even I don't completely hate Bente.</Text>
  <Text ID="261012">If Aunt Maggie won't fight tooth and nail for our blood, then I'll have to go it alone. </Text>
  <Text ID="261008">Aunt Maggie doesn't approve of barefaced vengeance.</Text>
  <Text ID="261009">I'll jam the crown down over her ears, for my father "Ben Harlow!"</Text>
  <Text ID="261010">I'll rip off Blake's toupee, and make him eat it like a dog.</Text>
  <Text ID="261011">Graves has it right, only death can wash away the pain!</Text>
  <Text ID="255583">Shouldda prised it from yer cold dead hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="255584">That's the going price for contraband.</Text>
  <Text ID="255585">Now to smuggle it out.</Text>
  <Text ID="255586">Share it out boys.</Text>
  <Text ID="255587">Are you kind, or blind?</Text>
  <Text ID="255588">No such thing as fair trade.</Text>
  <Text ID="255589">Mine by right anyway.</Text>
  <Text ID="256931">Shouldda prised it from yer cold dead hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="256930">That's the going price for contraband.</Text>
  <Text ID="256929">Now to smuggle it out.</Text>
  <Text ID="258490">Ho-ho, no.</Text>
  <Text ID="258491">I'd rather die.</Text>
  <Text ID="258492">Over my dead body!</Text>
  <Text ID="256327">You'll take it, if you know what's good fer yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="256334">I'd be biting off my hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="256335">Here's yer share.</Text>
  <Text ID="256336">Raise the black flag boys!</Text>
  <Text ID="256337">Ever deal with a pirate?</Text>
  <Text ID="256338">Have a heart-to-heart shall we?</Text>
  <Text ID="256339">I'm not here for the chatter.</Text>
  <Text ID="256328">My little fishes want feeding.</Text>
  <Text ID="256340">I can't wait to scratch out yer eyes.</Text>
  <Text ID="256341">Perhaps its time you met our Davy Jones?</Text>
  <Text ID="256342">If it's a fight you want, a fight ye shall 'ave.</Text>
  <Text ID="256329">I've no quarrel with it.</Text>
  <Text ID="256343">It'll have to do. </Text>
  <Text ID="256344">Seems fair.</Text>
  <Text ID="256345">Well, blow me down! </Text>
  <Text ID="256346">Fine, but it don't make yer a sea dog. </Text>
  <Text ID="256130">Trying to pull our legs?</Text>
  <Text ID="256147">No deal, dog.</Text>
  <Text ID="256148">I've made better deals with seals.</Text>
  <Text ID="256149">We pirates don't barter.</Text>
  <Text ID="256150">I'd rather kiss a monkey's dungbie.</Text>
  <Text ID="256131">Stop yer blubber, lubber.</Text>
  <Text ID="256151">Arrgh, leave me be.</Text>
  <Text ID="256152">Why talk when we could brawl?</Text>
  <Text ID="256153">Batten yer mouth or I will.</Text>
  <Text ID="256154">Shut yer gills!</Text>
  <Text ID="256330">Think you got us over a barrel?</Text>
  <Text ID="256347">You'll have to vie for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="256348">Not unless we get what's ours.</Text>
  <Text ID="256349">You haven't seen the last of us!</Text>
  <Text ID="256350">You'll pay for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="256351">We'll only take it out on someone else.</Text>
  <Text ID="256352">We'll never yield to a bluejacket.</Text>
  <Text ID="256353">What have we got to lose?</Text>
  <Text ID="256354">But, we're dead already.</Text>
  <Text ID="256355">I've thrown you a ladder.</Text>
  <Text ID="256356">You were saved by the code.</Text>
  <Text ID="256357">Profit apiece.</Text>
  <Text ID="256358">A pirate blessing.</Text>
  <Text ID="256359">Better than a kick to the rigging.</Text>
  <Text ID="256360">Walk the board!</Text>
  <Text ID="256361">No quarter!</Text>
  <Text ID="256362">Have some, fishface.</Text>
  <Text ID="256363">A shot across yer bows.</Text>
  <Text ID="256364">How are yer sea legs?</Text>
  <Text ID="257968">Here's an easy target lads.</Text>
  <Text ID="257970">You look like a royalist, that's enough for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="257971">Prepare to be boarded.</Text>
  <Text ID="257969">Count yerself lucky, yer pimple.</Text>
  <Text ID="257972">And they say Annie has no mercy...</Text>
  <Text ID="258508">None of that pity, just the laying down of arms.</Text>
  <Text ID="258509">I don't expect you'll show mercy. </Text>
  <Text ID="258523">Don't waste yer effort, we're dead already.</Text>
  <Text ID="258510">Trade us in, and we'll box you good and proper.</Text>
  <Text ID="258511">We pirates have special terms.</Text>
  <Text ID="258512">Willing to pay the price?</Text>
  <Text ID="258513">From now on, you'll stay away, d'yer hear?</Text>
  <Text ID="258514">Deal with my men again and I'll cut you a smile.</Text>
  <Text ID="258515">Haven't you heard? Pirates never barter! </Text>
  <Text ID="258516">Not 'cos we want to, 'cos we have to.</Text>
  <Text ID="258517">On one condition; you're still not a pirate.</Text>
  <Text ID="258518">Finally got you off our backs.</Text>
  <Text ID="258519">Good news, we don't need you any more. </Text>
  <Text ID="258520">Don't think you'll be getting any more. </Text>
  <Text ID="258521">This is an exception!</Text>
  <Text ID="258522">We'll have it back soon enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="256365">Blimey.</Text>
  <Text ID="256370">Ho!</Text>
  <Text ID="256371">Sink me!</Text>
  <Text ID="256372">Ye old Sturgeon!</Text>
  <Text ID="256373">Thinks like one of us!</Text>
  <Text ID="256374">Bluejacket.</Text>
  <Text ID="256375">Bilgewater.</Text>
  <Text ID="256376">You and yer long clothes.</Text>
  <Text ID="256377">Arrrgh!</Text>
  <Text ID="256378">Belay that blunder!</Text>
  <Text ID="257973">Think you can harm what's already dead!</Text>
  <Text ID="257974">Oh we're prepared to fight to the death.</Text>
  <Text ID="257975">Ere, this little fish has come to us!</Text>
  <Text ID="257976">I don't need telling enough's enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="257977">Fine, but stay out of our way.</Text>
  <Text ID="258493">It's rare we leave any alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="258494">Call that a storm, why it was nothing at all!</Text>
  <Text ID="258495">Fine, but I decide where we meet. </Text>
  <Text ID="258496">Smuggling? What of it...? </Text>
  <Text ID="258497">We usually meet by the light of the moon.</Text>
  <Text ID="258498">That just makes you fair game again, right boys?</Text>
  <Text ID="258499">Whatsay we come for your goods just the same? </Text>
  <Text ID="258500">Makes no odds to us how you want to be stung. </Text>
  <Text ID="258501">A fellow outcast eh? I'll be the judge of that.</Text>
  <Text ID="258502">Ye will never last with ol' Annie.</Text>
  <Text ID="258503">I knew you wouldn't stick it with us for long. </Text>
  <Text ID="258504">We prefer our own company anyway. </Text>
  <Text ID="257978">Because everyone knows pirates like doubloons.</Text>
  <Text ID="257979">Fine, we'll top up the "old sea chest".</Text>
  <Text ID="257980">That's the funniest thing I've heard in forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="257988">Just when I thought all comedy had died with my family.</Text>
  <Text ID="257989">You might just be the only person angrier than me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257990">Your acting's pretty convincing, got any tips?</Text>
  <Text ID="257981">Tough as nails, you say? But I've got a handful of pretty tough nails right here...</Text>
  <Text ID="257991">"Ra-ra-rah" you big toff. Take yer society repartee and stick it up yer blunderbuss.</Text>
  <Text ID="257992">Oh and while we're there, why not invite me and the horde for afternoon tea?</Text>
  <Text ID="257993">How wonderful, you've taken pity on us. </Text>
  <Text ID="257982">It's not from a toy box, this outfit is genuine!</Text>
  <Text ID="257995">I was born to be a pirate, and you'll swear on your head to tell no other tale!</Text>
  <Text ID="257996">Lies! There's nothing left of the old me!</Text>
  <Text ID="257997">There'll be no-one to mourn you either, once I'm finished killing!</Text>
  <Text ID="257983">A true pirate? I've heard worse about me than that.</Text>
  <Text ID="257998">Volatile, Vengeful, Vicious?  Yeah...sounds like me. </Text>
  <Text ID="257999">Aye. The bigwigs have the weapons, but only we know how to slash 'em!</Text>
  <Text ID="258000">Aye, maybe there was good in me once, then it died overnight.</Text>
  <Text ID="254794">In another life, we might have been cronies.</Text>
  <Text ID="256379">Still spring in our cable.</Text>
  <Text ID="256380">They best leave us alone, eh? </Text>
  <Text ID="256381">'S'pose I could hate you more.</Text>
  <Text ID="256382">Looks like the rope's got us tied. </Text>
  <Text ID="256383">Why do I always come about to you?</Text>
  <Text ID="256384">At least you've a few rough edges.</Text>
  <Text ID="256385">I've been known to spare the odd cove.</Text>
  <Text ID="256386">There's no forgiving, never!</Text>
  <Text ID="256387">Only a fool loosens their grip.</Text>
  <Text ID="256388">I have this nagging feeling you're a jellyfish.</Text>
  <Text ID="256389">We don't need you dragging us down.</Text>
  <Text ID="256390">You'll always be a goodie-goodie.</Text>
  <Text ID="256391">I reckon I could make you cry like a little girl.</Text>
  <Text ID="256392">You'd only weigh me to the bottom.</Text>
  <Text ID="256393">Deep down I know you're a tattle-tale.</Text>
  <Text ID="265634">We aren't friends, we're allies.</Text>
  <Text ID="265635">Us against the world!</Text>
  <Text ID="265637">Your politics sicken me.</Text>
  <Text ID="265638">You lot and your etiquette.</Text>
  <Text ID="265640">I stick by my recruits you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="265641">Yer a real dog, aren't ya? </Text>
  <Text ID="265643">Harsh! I like that! </Text>
  <Text ID="265644">An enemy's enemy and all that. </Text>
  <Text ID="265636">You don't want to mess with Anne's mates.</Text>
  <Text ID="265642">Come for me next then, and I'll nut yer. </Text>
  <Text ID="265639">We like a traitor.</Text>
  <Text ID="265645">Skulduggery is second nature to us.  </Text>
  <Text ID="256062">Wi' a wannion!</Text>
  <Text ID="256080">Vengeance!</Text>
  <Text ID="256081">Arrrgghh!</Text>
  <Text ID="256082">Memento mori!</Text>
  <Text ID="256083">Oh, this is personal!</Text>
  <Text ID="256063">Won't get me alive!</Text>
  <Text ID="268018">We got company, boys!</Text>
  <Text ID="268019">I can't fight as well as any!</Text>
  <Text ID="268020">Won't go without a fight!</Text>
  <Text ID="268021">Come here to be skewered?! </Text>
  <Text ID="256064">Our thirst ain't quenched.</Text>
  <Text ID="256084">Just a taste of what's to come.</Text>
  <Text ID="256085">And we'll scuttle more yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="256065">Their ghosts'll take you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256086">Yer asking for the cutlass.</Text>
  <Text ID="256087">Every man will be avenged!</Text>
  <Text ID="256066">Burn it all down!</Text>
  <Text ID="256088">Spare nothing and no-one!</Text>
  <Text ID="256067">Break it all down, I don't care.</Text>
  <Text ID="261512">I'll smash something of yours soon enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="256069">Now you know what it's like to have lost everything and everyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="256071">I didn't need them, I don't need anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="268022">They meant nothing to me!</Text>
  <Text ID="256072">Now kill the rest of them!</Text>
  <Text ID="268023">We'll be drinking to death tonight!</Text>
  <Text ID="256073">Found a uniform in the toy box have yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="256089">If fighting's all we have, then bring it on!</Text>
  <Text ID="256090">Better to die fighting, than drown in sorrow.</Text>
  <Text ID="256091">Good to see you flying the flag.</Text>
  <Text ID="256074">Toothless as a toad.</Text>
  <Text ID="256092">Nobody trifles with Annie Harlow.</Text>
  <Text ID="256093">You don't know the sharp end of a cutlass!</Text>
  <Text ID="256094">Got something to say to me, then say it?</Text>
  <Text ID="256075">Going back on our promise wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.</Text>
  <Text ID="261514">I'd rather fight without you, but we had an agreement.</Text>
  <Text ID="261513">I'm fighting your ally, save time and say I can drown you both. </Text>
  <Text ID="256076">I said I'd help, so I'll help, alright? </Text>
  <Text ID="261515">Just 'cos I fight for you, doesn't make us friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="256077">There'll be nothing to choose between you and these poor sods, once you're in the grave.</Text>
  <Text ID="261516">Come here at your peril.</Text>
  <Text ID="261517">I told you to stay away, or do you need you ears opening?</Text>
  <Text ID="256078">These men know the art of dying.</Text>
  <Text ID="261518">Not even death can make us happy.</Text>
  <Text ID="261519">Their blood'll beat while your heart still does.</Text>
  <Text ID="256079">I'll come back for you, be sure of that.</Text>
  <Text ID="256095">I'll drink my fill of revenge, just you wait.</Text>
  <Text ID="256096">You haven't seen the last of Anne Harlow's flintlocks.</Text>
  <Text ID="264842">I'm back from the dead, and I've brought friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="264843">Ain't you learned by now, I'm unkillable!</Text>
  <Text ID="264844">I decide when I die thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266021">A war with Aunt Maggs? Ohoho, you're done for!</Text>
  <Text ID="266033">Oh, Aunt Maggs'll look after you alright.</Text>
  <Text ID="268024">Look at them, all cheery, they make me sick. </Text>
  <Text ID="268025">Powder and a beauty spot, to cover yer blemishes? </Text>
  <Text ID="268026">I'll admit, your people are willing to fight!</Text>
  <Text ID="255486">How about a day in the fields? I can pay you for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255487">You'll get paid, same as any of my men.</Text>
  <Text ID="255488">We could use just about anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="255489">You can see, it's there for the taking.</Text>
  <Text ID="255490">Never look a gift horse in the mouth.</Text>
  <Text ID="255491">Good luck!</Text>
  <Text ID="255492">Carpe diem!</Text>
  <Text ID="255493">I hope you've got a system...</Text>
  <Text ID="255494">I greatly appreciate that.</Text>
  <Text ID="255495">You co-operate?!</Text>
  <Text ID="255496">You surprise me!</Text>
  <Text ID="255499">Where is your loyalty!?</Text>
  <Text ID="255500">Do you play me false?</Text>
  <Text ID="255501">Don't give me those hang-dog eyes.</Text>
  <Text ID="255502">This one's on the house, but next time...</Text>
  <Text ID="255503">We all have our bad days.</Text>
  <Text ID="255504">People are dying, and you sit on your hands?</Text>
  <Text ID="255505">I'm glad you have time to waste.</Text>
  <Text ID="255506">There is such a thing as hard work.</Text>
  <Text ID="255507">We still need to turn this situation around!</Text>
  <Text ID="255508">Another game?</Text>
  <Text ID="255509">Time to deal again.</Text>
  <Text ID="255510">I'm more than a side bet.</Text>
  <Text ID="255511">May as well flip a coin for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255512">Show me what you have.</Text>
  <Text ID="255513">Let me see your hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="255514">Has my boat come in?</Text>
  <Text ID="257218">Now's not a good time.</Text>
  <Text ID="257219">I can't work with you right now.</Text>
  <Text ID="257220">If I had something I'd give it to you. </Text>
  <Text ID="257221">I'm going to have to ask for your help.</Text>
  <Text ID="257222">I smell trouble on the high seas.</Text>
  <Text ID="257223">Normally we go it alone, but…</Text>
  <Text ID="258524">Then a tiny independent nation rises proudly above the sea of injustice.</Text>
  <Text ID="258525">I'd gamble on me too, there's a bet I know I can't lose.</Text>
  <Text ID="258526">Then the die is cast. Our people have everything to fight for. </Text>
  <Text ID="258527">Better keep a poker face. </Text>
  <Text ID="258528">Bondye Bon.</Text>
  <Text ID="258529">The odds are in our favour.</Text>
  <Text ID="258530">Shows we're right to be persistent.</Text>
  <Text ID="258531">These moments are almost worth the struggle.</Text>
  <Text ID="258532">Something good to tell my little girl.</Text>
  <Text ID="258533">Bull's eye.</Text>
  <Text ID="258534">Don't waste that acumen of yours. </Text>
  <Text ID="258535">You might be bona fide after all.</Text>
  <Text ID="258536">You're good!</Text>
  <Text ID="258537">Look at you swagger!</Text>
  <Text ID="258538">I know you must be a libertarian deep down. </Text>
  <Text ID="258539">It's easy to get drawn in by you. </Text>
  <Text ID="258540">Are you finally embracing a just cause?</Text>
  <Text ID="258541">Things are hard enough as it is! </Text>
  <Text ID="258542">What am I going to tell my wife and daughter?</Text>
  <Text ID="258543">We don't need any more misfortune! </Text>
  <Text ID="258544">We just going to have to endure this. </Text>
  <Text ID="258545">Some hands you have to live with.</Text>
  <Text ID="258546">We're not ones to fold, no matter what! </Text>
  <Text ID="258547">Only a coward would give in now. </Text>
  <Text ID="258548">I don't think you're genuine. </Text>
  <Text ID="258549">You know, I scarcely need agitating.</Text>
  <Text ID="258550">So snake eyes, it's that how it is?</Text>
  <Text ID="258551">Always did have you down as a despot. </Text>
  <Text ID="258552">What have you done?! </Text>
  <Text ID="258553">I'd hate to punish you, but if that's what it takes. </Text>
  <Text ID="258554">I've tried everything with you… </Text>
  <Text ID="255396">La Fortune. Play fair, we'll get along. Play foul, and I'll get along without you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255397">Anchante. If me and my people should misbehave, remember, there's misbehaving all over. </Text>
  <Text ID="256853">Warm seas lap these shores.</Text>
  <Text ID="256876">Welcome, everyone is welcome here.</Text>
  <Text ID="256877">We all need a place to call home.</Text>
  <Text ID="256878">Liberty, equality and brotherhood.</Text>
  <Text ID="256879">I could have lit up the barbecue!</Text>
  <Text ID="256880">That fervour of drums - that's when I know I'm home.</Text>
  <Text ID="256881">Salut, ami.</Text>
  <Text ID="260914">Sherwood forest, where the merry men hide out. </Text>
  <Text ID="260915">Our code may be strict, but it keeps our feet on the ground.</Text>
  <Text ID="260916">We're our own masters now, and we're building something here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260917">Little by little, the bird builds its nest. </Text>
  <Text ID="260918">Now we've a taste of freedom, we're not going to let go.</Text>
  <Text ID="260919">If only people listened, we'd lay down our guns.</Text>
  <Text ID="260920">We've had to fight to keep ourselves afloat.</Text>
  <Text ID="260921">I hope there comes a time we can stop fighting.</Text>
  <Text ID="258555">Thank the Almighty.</Text>
  <Text ID="258556">I'm grateful.</Text>
  <Text ID="258557">Lord knows we needed it.</Text>
  <Text ID="258558">As you wish.</Text>
  <Text ID="258559">Wi.</Text>
  <Text ID="258560">We're fine with it.</Text>
  <Text ID="261014">Independence works two ways - rely on no-one, and no-one relies on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="261015">I have a young family whose hopes rest on a roll of the dice. But at least we have dice to roll.</Text>
  <Text ID="261016">Who will benefit from our defiance? All that are human.</Text>
  <Text ID="261017">I'm pretty good at talking my way out,  but I rarely get that luxury.</Text>
  <Text ID="261018">If we're such small fish, why can't they just let us swim?</Text>
  <Text ID="261020">I'm sure the Empire's just as bad as La Corona. Of course, I wouldn't tell Her Majesty that!</Text>
  <Text ID="261021">We may seem dissimilar, but Beryl and I are a lot alike.</Text>
  <Text ID="261022">George should consider practising what he preaches.</Text>
  <Text ID="261023">Archibald's 'constitution' is unconstitutional, just like every government ever.</Text>
  <Text ID="261024">Anne's got no code. She'll fight anyone and everyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="261025">I wouldn't wager a newt on Wibblesock, if he were the last egg in the pond.</Text>
  <Text ID="261026">At least Bente came here and heard us out, but I wouldn't want her to have to help us.</Text>
  <Text ID="261027">Eli Bleakworth's kind don't see beyond lines, it's all always black or white.</Text>
  <Text ID="261028">If Alonso cooperated, we'd have this place for ourselves. But he's crazy, insane!</Text>
  <Text ID="261029">Lady Margaret? I'd be surprised if she didn't have her moments of madness.</Text>
  <Text ID="261030">Gasparov's French is impressive, from the outside at least.</Text>
  <Text ID="255590">You got yourself an agreement.</Text>
  <Text ID="255591">See, turned out good for both of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="255592">Taken with a pinch o' salt.</Text>
  <Text ID="255593">See, you can trust me.</Text>
  <Text ID="255594">I cherish this marriage.</Text>
  <Text ID="255595">I'll keep it under my cloak.</Text>
  <Text ID="255596">I told you I was peaceable.</Text>
  <Text ID="256932">You got yourself an agreement.</Text>
  <Text ID="256933">See, turned out good for both of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="256934">Taken with a pinch o' salt.</Text>
  <Text ID="258561">Non.</Text>
  <Text ID="258562">No dice.</Text>
  <Text ID="258563">When chicks teethe. </Text>
  <Text ID="256394">Come on, you can't lose!</Text>
  <Text ID="256395">We only ask what we need.</Text>
  <Text ID="256396">Both our concerns only stand to gain.</Text>
  <Text ID="256397">Has to be a risk worth taking.</Text>
  <Text ID="256398">The first thing is to lay down some rules.</Text>
  <Text ID="256399">I'm just trying to keep my people safe.</Text>
  <Text ID="256400">My people make their own rules</Text>
  <Text ID="256401">You want to dance the danse macabre?</Text>
  <Text ID="256402">We don't have to deal on paper.</Text>
  <Text ID="256403">On the bright side, it'll be over soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="256404">Some of us have to live by the sword.</Text>
  <Text ID="256405">As you decree.</Text>
  <Text ID="256406">That might just work.</Text>
  <Text ID="256407">We might trust each other yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="256408">First reasonable person I've met.</Text>
  <Text ID="256409">I make no bones.</Text>
  <Text ID="256132">Who are you, Machiavelli?</Text>
  <Text ID="256159">I know a swindle when I see one.</Text>
  <Text ID="256160">Don't you try to play me.</Text>
  <Text ID="256161">My people deserve better.</Text>
  <Text ID="256162">No dice.</Text>
  <Text ID="256134">That's my limit, I'm out.</Text>
  <Text ID="256163">Look, I've got a nation to build.</Text>
  <Text ID="256164">Ask me again later, and I'll tell you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256165">Better back out while I still can.</Text>
  <Text ID="256166">I have to run.</Text>
  <Text ID="256410">Let's up the ante.</Text>
  <Text ID="256411">Oh, we can hold our own.</Text>
  <Text ID="256412">Is that all you have?</Text>
  <Text ID="256413">Woah there, put some water in your wine.</Text>
  <Text ID="256414">Go ahead, don't mind us.</Text>
  <Text ID="256415">Sometimes you have to set your principles aside. </Text>
  <Text ID="256416">You're just throwing flowers.</Text>
  <Text ID="256417">We don't answer to anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="256418">A new nation needs courage.</Text>
  <Text ID="256419">This gives me great pleasure.</Text>
  <Text ID="256421">Feels good to be good.</Text>
  <Text ID="256422">Some island hospitality.</Text>
  <Text ID="256423">See, not all bad!</Text>
  <Text ID="256424">You're welcome.</Text>
  <Text ID="256420">Didn't have to be like this.</Text>
  <Text ID="256425">We all have to survive.</Text>
  <Text ID="256426">I'm sorry, this is the only way.</Text>
  <Text ID="256427">I apologise. </Text>
  <Text ID="256428">Don't think this isn’t hard for me too.</Text>
  <Text ID="258001">All in.</Text>
  <Text ID="258002">I'm sorry, this is the only way.</Text>
  <Text ID="258003">You've forced my hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="258004">There's a better place for both of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="258005">You and I are the same, we don't have to hurt each other.</Text>
  <Text ID="258570">Let's both take a step back for a moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="258571">Some of us need time to regroup! </Text>
  <Text ID="258572">Oh, are we still fighting?</Text>
  <Text ID="258573">This should be a land of free and fair trade.</Text>
  <Text ID="258574">You can't afford to miss opportunities here. </Text>
  <Text ID="258575">We will be a respected trading nation like the rest.</Text>
  <Text ID="258576">Our terms of trade were a joke from the beginning. </Text>
  <Text ID="258577">There's no benefit to us in working with you. </Text>
  <Text ID="258578">We've got our own economy now.</Text>
  <Text ID="258579">No need for animosity, why don't we help each other?</Text>
  <Text ID="258580">I promisenot to back out at the crucial moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="258581">I don't think you have my people's interests at heart. </Text>
  <Text ID="258582">You know, we do pretty well on our own.</Text>
  <Text ID="258583">A token of my people's good will. </Text>
  <Text ID="258584">Share and share alike, I say.</Text>
  <Text ID="258585">What can I say, I'm the giving type. </Text>
  <Text ID="256430">Now that has promise.</Text>
  <Text ID="256432">Looking good.</Text>
  <Text ID="256433">A fine idea!</Text>
  <Text ID="256434">You are so generous.</Text>
  <Text ID="256435">Wi, silvouplè.</Text>
  <Text ID="256431">Just a minute now.</Text>
  <Text ID="256436">You make it all up as you go.</Text>
  <Text ID="256437">What rules were we playing?</Text>
  <Text ID="256438">Tell me you're joking.</Text>
  <Text ID="256439">Now that's just unfriendly.</Text>
  <Text ID="258006">So, it's like that?</Text>
  <Text ID="258008">Come get us, we're not afraid.</Text>
  <Text ID="258009">We're ready for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258007">I can't say I'm not relieved.</Text>
  <Text ID="258010">My people will be glad to hear it.</Text>
  <Text ID="258587">You're right, we need some perspective.</Text>
  <Text ID="258588">I also have my wife and children to think about.</Text>
  <Text ID="258589">Of course, we're always interested in commerce.</Text>
  <Text ID="258590">Well why wouldn't you trade with us?</Text>
  <Text ID="258591">What could possibly go wrong!</Text>
  <Text ID="258592">It's ok, we don't have to deal. </Text>
  <Text ID="258593">Strike out alone, I won't be a hypocrite.</Text>
  <Text ID="258594">Maybe its better we do our own thing. </Text>
  <Text ID="258595">I look forward to working with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258596">An alliance built to last.</Text>
  <Text ID="258597">We all have our reasons, don't let me stop you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258598">No need to apologise, I understand.</Text>
  <Text ID="258014">How could I possibly refuse? </Text>
  <Text ID="258015">Every little bit could make the difference for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="257984">Con man?! That's just to you, never my people.</Text>
  <Text ID="258031">That's not fickle, that's sensible! Some of us have to play the long game!</Text>
  <Text ID="258032">Liar?! Tell me, who in this age does not perambulate the suburbs of veracity?</Text>
  <Text ID="258033">Vile or not, those weapons grant us our freedom.</Text>
  <Text ID="257985">Dapper? I've got more important things to think about than frills and silks.</Text>
  <Text ID="258034">Don't you think I know a gallant from a shark by now? </Text>
  <Text ID="258035">Spin your wheel somewhere else, friend, I do not exist to be played.</Text>
  <Text ID="258036">Put a coin in and see what comes out? Non, you'll get no change from me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257986">'Might as well give up? We don't have to listen to this.</Text>
  <Text ID="258037">Mock all you want, but we will come through this a free people. </Text>
  <Text ID="258038">A coward?! Now I'm insulted. </Text>
  <Text ID="258039">There's only one side I'm fighting for; the one my wife and child are on.</Text>
  <Text ID="257987">I don't know if I'm a good father, but she and mama are safe, that's what's important.</Text>
  <Text ID="258040">I pride myself on that good grace, no matter the...circumstances.</Text>
  <Text ID="258041">A good sport? I am always that - lucky for you!</Text>
  <Text ID="258042">A champion of civil rights? I hope so, I hope so.</Text>
  <Text ID="256440">You could be the joker in this pack.</Text>
  <Text ID="256441">When its down to me and you, let's not fight?</Text>
  <Text ID="256442">I don't need a quarrel with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256443">If I had to back a cockerel, it might be you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256444">We don't have to live at odds.</Text>
  <Text ID="256445">I'm not going to say I trust you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256446">Do I really have a conviction in you?</Text>
  <Text ID="256447">Something about you still gives my people hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="256448">Dealing with you could be a lottery.</Text>
  <Text ID="256449">Little fish are careful who they swim with.</Text>
  <Text ID="256450">Don't trust me?! It's the other way around.</Text>
  <Text ID="256451">I have to think what's best for us. </Text>
  <Text ID="256452">I have you down as a worry.</Text>
  <Text ID="256453">We like to think independently.</Text>
  <Text ID="256454">I better watch what I say.</Text>
  <Text ID="256455">Experience can teach a person a lot.</Text>
  <Text ID="265646">There are not many I can call friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="265647">If we people of principle don't support each other… </Text>
  <Text ID="265649">Hypocrisy is the only language the privileged speak. </Text>
  <Text ID="265650">Are you done kissing their feet? </Text>
  <Text ID="265652">Do you need a lesson in manners from a pirate? </Text>
  <Text ID="265653">Well, that was rude.</Text>
  <Text ID="265655">I bet that will sting for days. </Text>
  <Text ID="265656">Wish I could have seen their face. </Text>
  <Text ID="265648">Hey, I'll play the trickster around here… </Text>
  <Text ID="265654">At least try to keep your cards close to your chest!</Text>
  <Text ID="265651">Now that is a very clever thing indeed!</Text>
  <Text ID="265657">Please, don't let me stop you! </Text>
  <Text ID="256097">Sorry but we're desperate.</Text>
  <Text ID="256098">My rules now.</Text>
  <Text ID="256099">Let's play dice.</Text>
  <Text ID="256100">It's easier if you don’t fight! </Text>
  <Text ID="256101">My people need this.</Text>
  <Text ID="256102">So, it's come to this.</Text>
  <Text ID="268010">I will protect my family.</Text>
  <Text ID="268011">You didn't have to do this.</Text>
  <Text ID="268012">We've survived worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="268013">Why us?</Text>
  <Text ID="256103">Someone had to take the fall.</Text>
  <Text ID="256104">Could have been anyone...</Text>
  <Text ID="256105">Your luck's not in.</Text>
  <Text ID="256106">Not the first gamble that didn't pay.</Text>
  <Text ID="256107">They're good swimmers.</Text>
  <Text ID="256108">It was worth a shot!</Text>
  <Text ID="256109">It was begging to be knocked down.</Text>
  <Text ID="256110">Can you blame me?</Text>
  <Text ID="256111">You have to learn to manage your anger!</Text>
  <Text ID="261520">Come on, that's an inanimate object!</Text>
  <Text ID="256112">I'm sorry it had to be this way, but fish have to eat if they want to avoid being eaten.</Text>
  <Text ID="256113">A tragic loss…</Text>
  <Text ID="268014">They will be missed… </Text>
  <Text ID="256114">You shield us like a cloak.</Text>
  <Text ID="268015">You've shaken off quite a hindrance. </Text>
  <Text ID="256115">Got to keep your options open.</Text>
  <Text ID="256116">Everybody needs some kind of protection.</Text>
  <Text ID="256117">We all have something to preserve.</Text>
  <Text ID="256118">Please - you have a duty to your people.</Text>
  <Text ID="256119">Raising the stakes, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="256120">I see your cards, and you don't have much.</Text>
  <Text ID="256121">You think I'm worried?</Text>
  <Text ID="256122">I thought you were above that.</Text>
  <Text ID="256123">Our whole plan depends on you still being with us.</Text>
  <Text ID="261521">Will you protect me and my family as you said you would?</Text>
  <Text ID="261527">We are at war with your ally, let us see your true colours.</Text>
  <Text ID="256124">Of course friend, whatever you need.</Text>
  <Text ID="261522">It is a big risk for us, but wi, we will fight for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256125">They take up arms for the freedom of their colour.</Text>
  <Text ID="261523">They pray morning and evening this war will end.</Text>
  <Text ID="261524">We desire only to defend these properties and the families that inhabit them.</Text>
  <Text ID="256126">You found one ship, but others are on the move.</Text>
  <Text ID="261525">War is bad for you, we have allies everywhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="261526">They'll lay down arms the moment you make a fair peace offer.</Text>
  <Text ID="256127">We'll only come back stronger.</Text>
  <Text ID="256128">As old dreams die, new ones take shape.</Text>
  <Text ID="256129">Don't worry, we'll hide out as long as we need to.</Text>
  <Text ID="264845">This time, I'm going to get in with the right people.</Text>
  <Text ID="264846">We've rebuilt before, we can do it again.</Text>
  <Text ID="264847">The past is the past, the future is ours to protect.</Text>
  <Text ID="256205">I don't let anyone treat me like that.</Text>
  <Text ID="256206">You won't keep them down forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="265979">George supported me, so I support him!</Text>
  <Text ID="265984">Make him suffer as he made my people suffer.</Text>
  <Text ID="265991">George is an ally you can rely on.</Text>
  <Text ID="265996">If you support Silva, you support La Corona.</Text>
  <Text ID="268016">I can recongnise a cruel master.</Text>
  <Text ID="268017">You do what you have to, to protect your own. </Text>
  <Text ID="261186">Believe me I share Isabel's cause, but I already have enough trouble with the Empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="266600">I beg you, I don't want to live in a world of Pyrphorians. Make them go away.</Text>
  <Text ID="266601">Phew! That's one less threat to our survival that I have to take care of!</Text>
  <Text ID="256941">Please— we'll take any help we can get.</Text>
  <Text ID="256942">Your chance to fight for something worth fighting for.</Text>
  <Text ID="256943">These people, they need a hero.</Text>
  <Text ID="256944">Bring us the horizon, where the fire of freedom rises. </Text>
  <Text ID="256945">We're always looking to those we can trust.</Text>
  <Text ID="256946">We're counting on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256947">Tell no-one. Adeus. </Text>
  <Text ID="256948">Go, I trust you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256949">Without you, I don't know what we would have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="256950">One step closer to freedom.</Text>
  <Text ID="256951">You make it look easy!</Text>
  <Text ID="256952">You have done a beautiful thing this day.</Text>
  <Text ID="256953">Your brave actions may just have saved us.</Text>
  <Text ID="256954">Tell me, did they get to you?</Text>
  <Text ID="256955">Any way the wind blows, eh? We will be better without you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256956">The hopes of a generation, crushed.</Text>
  <Text ID="256957">Do you mean to sabotage us?</Text>
  <Text ID="256958">Not all will last in the struggle.</Text>
  <Text ID="256959">Do not turn your back on this fight!</Text>
  <Text ID="256960">There is a time for waiting, it is not now!</Text>
  <Text ID="256961">Do it now, while the moon lights the river.</Text>
  <Text ID="256962">This struggle, it is never over.</Text>
  <Text ID="256963">Obrigada. Still with us?</Text>
  <Text ID="256964">Freedom is so close, help us push through.</Text>
  <Text ID="256965">It is in all of us to support the underdog.</Text>
  <Text ID="256966">Don't be a fool, listen to your heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="256967">Olá. Tell me it's good news?</Text>
  <Text ID="256968">Did it go as planned?</Text>
  <Text ID="256969">Every second counts.</Text>
  <Text ID="257224">What I have would take too long to explain…</Text>
  <Text ID="257225">I must plan our next move.</Text>
  <Text ID="257226">Better keep our heads down for a while.</Text>
  <Text ID="257227">Ride with us, be ready.</Text>
  <Text ID="257228">Look after my people, they are all I have.</Text>
  <Text ID="257229">We must protect the vulnerable who cross the seas.</Text>
  <Text ID="266735">So, you found us. Take a look around. What can the henchmen of the Empire do to us that the Pyrphorians haven't already?</Text>
  <Text ID="266737">Goode? The man that sold Her Majesty's precious island to me? He is just as guilty as I am!</Text>
  <Text ID="266738">So you are calling me as a liar? Love is blind. Back before they left their fiery mark, the Pyrphorians told me your father would come— to sell me Prosperity.</Text>
  <Text ID="266739">I knew conspiring against the Empire was a bad idea. Afterwards, when I refused to work with the Pyrphorians, they came to teach us a lesson.</Text>
  <Text ID="266740">Now our movement drills their oil for nothing, night and day. We have lost the strength to fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="266741">Still we are afraid. And even though we buried the dead and found a hideaway, I cannot provide shelter for all of them.</Text>
  <Text ID="266742">So you won't let go? Then let's get to business. Help me shelter and protect the good people that are part of this movement. If I see you can be trusted, I will find you the treaty that sealed the deal on Prosperity. Are you in?</Text>
  <Text ID="266853">Then we too were betrayed. We will leave Prosperity immediately, your Majesty.</Text>
  <Text ID="266854">They are more than a nuisance! And they will never accept this. You must be careful!</Text>
  <Text ID="267070">Build us a haven on La Isla, and we can talk about getting you that contract.</Text>
  <Text ID="267075">We will help you. But first you have to help us. </Text>
  <Text ID="267076">The Pyrphorians would only exploit us if we tried to resettle ourselves. But with an island under your flag…</Text>
  <Text ID="267077">This place is more than good enough for us. We are used to living on very little.</Text>
  <Text ID="267078">They are mostly just civilians, hoping for somewhere they can feel safe.</Text>
  <Text ID="267079">This can be our fortress. A beautiful garden away from terrible things. We must protect it.</Text>
  <Text ID="267080">Once this is over I promise to repay you. Right now, I care about my people's safety!</Text>
  <Text ID="267081">We must be ready for the Pyrphorians if they come. </Text>
  <Text ID="267082">You could make the resistance yet! We are grateful to have such security now.</Text>
  <Text ID="267083">You're doing amazing work. Together we will fight them with everything we have!</Text>
  <Text ID="267084">Now you can focus on La Isla. Securing the future of men, women, children!</Text>
  <Text ID="267085">Prosperity has been nothing but trouble for us. Go see for yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="267086">My followers on that island are living in fear!</Text>
  <Text ID="267087">The persecuted, the diaspora, flock to La Isla. We must shelter them.</Text>
  <Text ID="267088">We need to be able to hold out should the Pyrphorians strike. Anything you can provide will help.</Text>
  <Text ID="267089">I feel bad for asking. But these people come here pockets empty.</Text>
  <Text ID="267090">This place, La Isla, can be a fortress of salvation to these people.</Text>
  <Text ID="267091">I didn't know if I could trust you. But you have given these people hope, and a future.</Text>
  <Text ID="267092">We must get the people what they need, before the Pyrphorians can break our supply lines.</Text>
  <Text ID="267093">Your father was guilty. I was with him when he signed the contract.</Text>
  <Text ID="267094">I wouldn't be surprised if the Pyrphorians pressured your father too.</Text>
  <Text ID="267095">The Pyrphorians took Prosperity from us the moment that deal was signed.</Text>
  <Text ID="267096">Helping you is too risky right now. My people need shelter from the Pyrphorian menace.</Text>
  <Text ID="267097">We had no choice. The Pyrphorians coerced us into buying Prosperity from your father.</Text>
  <Text ID="267098">Prosperity is so rich in natural resources. No wonder it is the source of all this conflict.</Text>
  <Text ID="267099">We want to forge something new, break away from the old. </Text>
  <Text ID="267100">I trust your Empire no more than the Pyrphorians. We are just pawns in their game.</Text>
  <Text ID="267101">Break free of La Corona, only to land in the lap of these Pyrphorian devils.  </Text>
  <Text ID="267102">They will torch the whole city, if you try to meddle. I suggest setting up routine patrols! </Text>
  <Text ID="267103">Then the fires begin. It is their warning. You must find these masks who walk with the devil!</Text>
  <Text ID="267104">The scars the fire leaves behind do not heal fast.</Text>
  <Text ID="267105">We need a dedicated team to police the arsonists.</Text>
  <Text ID="267106">I don't think your sister likes me. But I have to keep fighting for what I believe in.</Text>
  <Text ID="267107">With your patrols, we can catch the arsonists in the act. </Text>
  <Text ID="267108">Catch the Pyrphorian arsonists!</Text>
  <Text ID="267109">It is these arsonists turn to be afraid!</Text>
  <Text ID="267110">The Pyrphorians work the weak to collapse. La Isla is their only hope of recovery.</Text>
  <Text ID="267111">Have sympathy for the many who are sick. Exhausted from the mines and the oil pumps.</Text>
  <Text ID="267112">There are many who struggle even to walk, cruelly made to work.</Text>
  <Text ID="267113">This is becoming a crisis. I worry the sick may die if we do not give them beds and clean linen.</Text>
  <Text ID="267114">Their homes were taken from them. Help them dream again.</Text>
  <Text ID="267115">First La Corona, now the Pyrphorians. If we come through this with our lives, we'll be lucky.</Text>
  <Text ID="267116">Take the sick and the weak from Prosperity to La Isla. Save them from a life of exploitation.</Text>
  <Text ID="267117">I cannot watch my people struggling under the Pyrphorian yoke.</Text>
  <Text ID="267118">We cannot rely on the old guard, they have given so much of their lives already.</Text>
  <Text ID="267119">This shall be the moment our movement truly begins! New ideas, new energy!</Text>
  <Text ID="267120">The young ones dream of something better. Better homes and a better life.</Text>
  <Text ID="267121">Without somewhere to call home, it is over for them.</Text>
  <Text ID="267122">These refugees, they have nowhere else to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="267123">You have to learn to make what friends you can out here.</Text>
  <Text ID="267124">I hate knowing Empire or La Corona could just come here and crush us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267125">I'm sure your Queen wants to go charging in like a bull in a china shop. But good people still live on Prosperity.</Text>
  <Text ID="267126">I don't plan to leave anyone behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="267127">Keep the people moving. Now is not the time to stop and think.</Text>
  <Text ID="267128">All of us sticking together. That is the best chance we have of defending ourselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="267129">Even a modest fleet would give us independence.</Text>
  <Text ID="267130">It is not on land, but on water, where we are vulnerable.</Text>
  <Text ID="267131">Wow this ship is so beautiful!</Text>
  <Text ID="267132">We shall name her after my brother, and pin a lock of his hair to the mast.</Text>
  <Text ID="267133">Pyrphorian ships approach. I have never dealt with them face-to-face. What can they want?</Text>
  <Text ID="267134">It is started—there's no going back. The Pyrphorians never give up.</Text>
  <Text ID="267135">Everything we produce here, the Pyrphorians take.</Text>
  <Text ID="267136">After the Pyrphorians come for the tithe, there is nothing left for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267137">The cat is out of the bag. Now they know you are involved.</Text>
  <Text ID="267138">The Pyrphorian attack frightens them. Please, there must be room!</Text>
  <Text ID="267139">My island too must be evacuated, it is no longer safe there.</Text>
  <Text ID="267140">Many of my best were kidnapped. We have no hope of surviving without them.</Text>
  <Text ID="267141">What if these people grow sick, they're going to need a hospital!</Text>
  <Text ID="267285">My people's future is secure. They have you to thank for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="267353">The contract…it is gone! The Pyrphorians must have stolen it during the attack. How did I fall for such a simple diversion!</Text>
  <Text ID="267354">You are going to have to inflitrate the Pyrphorians if you want to find that contract. I'm sorry.</Text>
  <Text ID="267355">You beat the Pyrphorians at their own game!</Text>
  <Text ID="267356">If you can convince the Queen to listen, we can explain her.</Text>
  <Text ID="267357">I would give you that stupid island, if only I had the contract to tear to pieces.</Text>
  <Text ID="267358">We cannot thank you enough for preventing this war.</Text>
  <Text ID="267359">With that contract, we are taking the Pyrphorians down from the inside.</Text>
  <Text ID="267360">Prosperity is yours, take it! We have a new home now.</Text>
  <Text ID="267361">Near Prosperity, the Pyrphorians would kill us on sight.</Text>
  <Text ID="267362">At first I thought you were a spy of the Queen. Now I know your heart is in the right place.</Text>
  <Text ID="267363">I can tell you where the contract is. After that it's down to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="267364">Stay hidden, and you will succeed.</Text>
  <Text ID="267365">The man I met was your Uncle? I thought he was a creep!</Text>
  <Text ID="267366">I am sorry you had to go through all this just to have justice. </Text>
  <Text ID="267582">Of course I will be a witness. After all you've done for us. </Text>
  <Text ID="267597">With Prosperity off our hands, the Pyrphorians will leave us alone. </Text>
  <Text ID="267598">Let me help you. I know I can make a difference.</Text>
  <Text ID="267599">I will tell them everything I know.</Text>
  <Text ID="267600">I don't need to take an oath to speak the truth.</Text>
  <Text ID="267601">I hope as witness, I can prove the Pyrphorians were behind this deal, not us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267602">I was certain it was your father that day, but now I know was wrong.</Text>
  <Text ID="267603">Your majesty. Isabel Sarmento, at your service.</Text>
  <Text ID="267755">We fight with you, no matter what. </Text>
  <Text ID="267763">We can help you, just give us the sign.</Text>
  <Text ID="267764">Exploit their supply lines! Small operations can have big rewards! </Text>
  <Text ID="267765">Sabotage their supply lines! They rely on them as much as we do.</Text>
  <Text ID="267766">There is no dent in their supply! We missed an opportunity!</Text>
  <Text ID="267767">Ha, you did it! Without their precious fire they are nothing!</Text>
  <Text ID="267768">You broke the chain! Now we are really somewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="267769">I never thought I would take the Empire's side!</Text>
  <Text ID="267770">The Queen has promised to recognise our independence.</Text>
  <Text ID="267771">I like Sir Archibald, he is a funny man.</Text>
  <Text ID="259831">Of course we will take a stand beside you, if you are for freedom and justice!</Text>
  <Text ID="259832">Now is the time for choosing sides. Just or unjust.</Text>
  <Text ID="259833">We join on one condition, that like you we are free to write our own history.</Text>
  <Text ID="259834">We can build on this. </Text>
  <Text ID="259835">It is good news. </Text>
  <Text ID="259836">Let's take nothing for granted. </Text>
  <Text ID="259837">This is progress at least. </Text>
  <Text ID="259838">We are all the stronger for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="259839">A small win, but we'll take it.</Text>
  <Text ID="259840">A flicker of hope. </Text>
  <Text ID="259841">Champion of the underdog! </Text>
  <Text ID="259842">I wanted to believe you'd come through.</Text>
  <Text ID="259843">It takes courage to make a stand. </Text>
  <Text ID="259844">I was right to trust you. </Text>
  <Text ID="259845">Your heart is in the right place. </Text>
  <Text ID="259846">You have achieved a lot.</Text>
  <Text ID="259847">May there be more good news from you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259848">It is only a setback.</Text>
  <Text ID="259849">We will come back stronger. </Text>
  <Text ID="259850">Nothing we aren't ready for.</Text>
  <Text ID="259851">We can't give up.</Text>
  <Text ID="259852">This cannot be allowed to harm our plans. </Text>
  <Text ID="259853">We can find a way around this.</Text>
  <Text ID="259854">We've seen worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="259855">You should have more faith. </Text>
  <Text ID="259856">Are you crazy?  </Text>
  <Text ID="259857">I thought we had trust. </Text>
  <Text ID="259858">You will expose us. </Text>
  <Text ID="259859">I don't want to cut ties with you. </Text>
  <Text ID="259860">Ask youself, whose side are you on? </Text>
  <Text ID="259861">Don't burn all your bridges.  </Text>
  <Text ID="255402">I am Isabel Sarmento and I will see my country freed. Are you with me or against me?</Text>
  <Text ID="255403">I am Isabel Sarmento. Do not stand between me and my country's freedom!</Text>
  <Text ID="256854">You are sure you weren't followed?</Text>
  <Text ID="256894">Good to see a friendly face in these times.</Text>
  <Text ID="256895">You are here to help?</Text>
  <Text ID="256896">We're running low on everything, as usual.</Text>
  <Text ID="256897">We search all our visitors -  a necessary precaution.</Text>
  <Text ID="256898">We would welcome more volunteers.</Text>
  <Text ID="256899">Ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.</Text>
  <Text ID="260938">This is where liberation starts.</Text>
  <Text ID="260939">We make do with what we have.</Text>
  <Text ID="260940">I hope they'll remember this as the birthplace of a revolution.</Text>
  <Text ID="260941">This is our new home now, we should be happy for that.</Text>
  <Text ID="260942">We've got to be agile, ready to move at the drop of a hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="260943">We can load up in a day, and be gone in a night.</Text>
  <Text ID="260944">It's hard to get ships. We are lucky to have friends to help us.</Text>
  <Text ID="260945">We never sink a ship if we can take it.</Text>
  <Text ID="259862">We won't forget this.</Text>
  <Text ID="259863">I am so happy someone could help us.</Text>
  <Text ID="259864">Words can't express how grateful we are.</Text>
  <Text ID="259865">We could use a distraction.</Text>
  <Text ID="259866">We can make it work.</Text>
  <Text ID="259867">It is a risk worth taking.</Text>
  <Text ID="261059">I'll join them again in the fields... my brothers and sisters, once we have set this land free.</Text>
  <Text ID="261061">I was young when I joined the movement, I never imagined I would one day be giving the orders.</Text>
  <Text ID="261062">This is not about revenge, but securing our people a future free of La Corona. We have to stick together. </Text>
  <Text ID="261063">My brother fought back violently against La Corona. He was murdered. We have to try another way.</Text>
  <Text ID="261064">If we strike against La Corona, we have to make it count!</Text>
  <Text ID="261060">Jean is reckless like my brother was. I don't blame him. He is only trying to survive, to protect the ones he loves.</Text>
  <Text ID="261065">Let Admiral Silva cling to his dying dream, we hear the little birds of freedom sing! </Text>
  <Text ID="261066">La Corona may be our enemy, not the Queen, but to trust empire for us is impossible.</Text>
  <Text ID="261067">If Anne could forget the past, we could build a better future together. </Text>
  <Text ID="261068">Alonso is a powder keg. He threatens to destroy the delicate balance we've worked so hard for.</Text>
  <Text ID="261069">Madame Kahina is the best. Quick, clean, and never draws attention. How does she do it?</Text>
  <Text ID="261070">George dances well for an invalid, we all need to cut free sometimes.</Text>
  <Text ID="256689">In future, keep your flagship intact, resources are scarce.</Text>
  <Text ID="259868">There must be a better way.</Text>
  <Text ID="259869">There is no time for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="259870">This will not help our struggle.</Text>
  <Text ID="256970">I've uncovered a meaty opportunity.</Text>
  <Text ID="256971">You steam ahead, my 'ands are oily.</Text>
  <Text ID="256972">Something fer you to fiddle with.</Text>
  <Text ID="256973">Shine yer blow lamp on this would'yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="256974">If you don't exploit this, some other bird will.</Text>
  <Text ID="256975">Look at you go.</Text>
  <Text ID="256976">Go then, I got stuff to do.</Text>
  <Text ID="256977">That's it, gimme some peace.</Text>
  <Text ID="256978">Fixed that up good, didn't yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="256979">Nice juicy little oyster that is.</Text>
  <Text ID="256980">Faster than the electric telegraph.</Text>
  <Text ID="256981">Lickety-spit, you've come back quick.</Text>
  <Text ID="256982">Corrr yeah, just how I likes it.</Text>
  <Text ID="256983">Didn't take you for a Janus-face, fair play to yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="256984">You've left the whole thing a ruddy jumble!</Text>
  <Text ID="256985">Well that's the nail in the coffin.</Text>
  <Text ID="256986">Luddite!</Text>
  <Text ID="256987">Steaming pile full o' nothin'.</Text>
  <Text ID="256988">Hurry or the flies'll start laying.</Text>

  <Text ID="256992">Sputter on little engine, I'll keep you greased.</Text>
  <Text ID="256993">Wonderful, but I've got another turkey for you to pluck.</Text>
  <Text ID="256994">Bit of a wrench, eh?  </Text>
  <Text ID="256995">Old Nate can make double-cross worth your while.</Text>
  <Text ID="256996">Tied up the scrag ends?</Text>
  <Text ID="256997">Cobbled somethin' together?</Text>
  <Text ID="256998">Dug up more than bones?</Text>
  <Text ID="257235">Want more? There is no more!</Text>
  <Text ID="257236">Lean pickings at the moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="257237">Not even a morsel for yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="259928">Pumping pistons! </Text>
  <Text ID="259929">No flies on me.</Text>
  <Text ID="259930">I'm over the moon. </Text>
  <Text ID="259931">I'm lighter than air.</Text>
  <Text ID="259932">I'd be blown away, if not for me ropes… </Text>
  <Text ID="259933">Whizbang!</Text>
  <Text ID="259934">Soaring like a buzzard.</Text>
  <Text ID="259935">You're flying! </Text>
  <Text ID="259936">Self-propelled, I see.</Text>
  <Text ID="259937">You make silk purses from sow's ears. </Text>
  <Text ID="259938">Sift and you will find. </Text>
  <Text ID="259939">You've got a spark. </Text>
  <Text ID="259940">Something always drops from the pipe with you. </Text>
  <Text ID="259948">You're dynamite! </Text>
  <Text ID="259941">Rubbish!</Text>
  <Text ID="259942">Fly-blown frass!</Text>
  <Text ID="259943">It unhinges me!</Text>
  <Text ID="259944">Soiled my day. </Text>
  <Text ID="259945">Bahhh! </Text>
  <Text ID="259946">Hollow piles o' dung.</Text>
  <Text ID="259947">I haven't time for this! </Text>
  <Text ID="259949">You're cranking my crank. </Text>
  <Text ID="259950">Don't ratchet me temper!</Text>
  <Text ID="259951">I'll 'ave yer bones! </Text>
  <Text ID="259952">I've a bone to pick with you. </Text>
  <Text ID="259953">Yer damp and dirty drape.</Text>
  <Text ID="259954">Yer smudge-pot. </Text>
  <Text ID="259955">Oily little toerag.</Text>
  <Text ID="255404">Let me wipe me hand yer eminence. Turkey grease, see.</Text>
  <Text ID="255405">You made a lucky find! I'm a goto for scrags and cut-offs, knick-knacks and gravy.</Text>
  <Text ID="256855">Is it rag or is it bone you're wantin'?</Text>
  <Text ID="256900">Bear-skin, dog-skin, cat-skin.</Text>
  <Text ID="256901">Eh? I'm trying to keep a low profile.</Text>
  <Text ID="256902">I've a wealth o' parts, real odds and ends.</Text>
  <Text ID="256903">You've got me by the Diri-giblets, whaddya want?</Text>
  <Text ID="256904">You wouldn't be after a mountain of lint would ya?</Text>
  <Text ID="256905">What's that I can smell on you, pickled eggs?</Text>
  <Text ID="260950">Should hold together for a time.</Text>
  <Text ID="260951">Soldiers had no use for the iron, all frozen such as they were.</Text>
  <Text ID="260952">I scratched and scraped for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="260953">I always dreamed of a little shack to call my own.</Text>
  <Text ID="260954">She used to be a wreck, but you'd never guess.</Text>

  <Text ID="260957">Made of sterner stuff— like boiled hooves.</Text>
  <Text ID="259956">How touching.</Text>
  <Text ID="259957">I'm a grateful sackful.</Text>
  <Text ID="259958">Tinker very much.</Text>
  <Text ID="259959">I'm in.</Text>
  <Text ID="259960">Could be worse I s'pose.</Text>
  <Text ID="259961">Then what we waitin' for, let's get stuck in.</Text>
  <Text ID="261089">Semaphore stations'll soon be disused - there's a tip for old iron.</Text>
  <Text ID="261091">Found an egg with a palace in it. Fixed the hinge and stuck it on the bow of my lady blimp.</Text>
  <Text ID="261092">Zeppelins'll take off, you'll see. Soon they'll all want a piece of my lady blimp.</Text>
  <Text ID="261093">Turn a greasy hat inside out, and it looks to 'ave been oiled purposely!</Text>

  <Text ID="261100">Don't dabble with Kahina, she's a lethal businesswoman.</Text>
  <Text ID="261101">I offered Bente a place on my balloon, but she guffawed and called it cheating!</Text>
  <Text ID="255597">That fell into place.</Text>
  <Text ID="255598">Bit fer you, chunk for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="255599">A few sundries.</Text>
  <Text ID="255600">Some nice little slivers in there.</Text>
  <Text ID="255601">Something for nothing!</Text>
  <Text ID="255602">We hammered something out.</Text>
  <Text ID="255603">I'm an impulsive shopper myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="259962">I won't be manipulated. </Text>
  <Text ID="259963">What's in it for me?</Text>
  <Text ID="259964">Gorr, take me for an idiot?</Text>
  <Text ID="268053">Well, it's time for me to move on. Until we meet again!</Text>
  <Text ID="264848">You're going to need your best ship and crew, only for it to sink to the icy bottom! Hehehe.</Text>
  <Text ID="264849">Terrible waste of human life of course, but don't let that stop you. </Text>
  <Text ID="264850">And be sure to prepare for the final curtain while you're at it. </Text>
  <Text ID="264851">You really do have quite the desire to depart don't ya? Well it's your funeral.</Text>
  <Text ID="264852">Never mind, eh! At least you won't die a block of ice.</Text>
  <Text ID="264853">Seems a long way to go to die, but you look ready for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="264854">Take your time, won't make a difference to Sir John.</Text>
  <Text ID="264855">Congratulations! You crossed seven seas for a wasteland! </Text>
  <Text ID="264856">Couldn't even shoot yerself in the foot? Well I feel sorry for ya.</Text>
  <Text ID="264857">The whole expedition's a failure. But we all know that teamwork drivel's a myth.</Text>
  <Text ID="264858">See— never worth getting mixed up in other people's business.</Text>
  <Text ID="264859">What a waste of time! Just goes to show, you can't rely on others.</Text>
  <Text ID="264860">There's nothing up there but the  ruddy cold.</Text>
  <Text ID="264861">Hoping this will keep your head above water? Not Arctic water it won't.</Text>
  <Text ID="264862">Dunno why you're so desperate for your eyeballs to freeze.</Text>
  <Text ID="264863">At best we'll be pulling stiffs out the ice like teeth.</Text>
  <Text ID="264864">Like frostbite do ya? Botulism? Scurvy? Got that all to look forward to.</Text>
  <Text ID="264865">The Arctic's no more than a mariner's graveyard. Ooh, hang fire...</Text>
  <Text ID="264866">As we're here, we might ask the Inuits if they chanced upon any lost property...</Text>
  <Text ID="264867">The equipment won't have decomposed like the cadavers.</Text>
  <Text ID="264868">We've a responsibility to Sir John to gather up his valuables. </Text>
  <Text ID="264869">Hard to feel the cold when you see a glint, ain't it? Hehe.</Text>
  <Text ID="264870">Found nothing but emptiness, why isn't I surprised?</Text>
  <Text ID="264871">The deeper we go, the more likely we find something really juicy. </Text>
  <Text ID="264872">You want an Icebreaker, so we can get to the fancy stuff.</Text>
  <Text ID="264873">Never know what you'll find inside, if you don't crack things open.</Text>
  <Text ID="264874">Now we can finally see if Sir John bequeaths us owt shiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="264875">You need to grow yourself some tusks, my walrus-friend, or we'll never snag the goodies.</Text>
  <Text ID="264876">What d'you wanna help those old duffers for? Unless...you've sniffed summat out?</Text>
  <Text ID="264877">I've heard the Arctic Council ships are plushly furnished.</Text>
  <Text ID="264878">Shame they had to still be alive and we couldn't just help ourselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="264879">As long as their pocket watches still tick we should try afresh. </Text>
  <Text ID="264880">Never should o' come here, why do you think they call it a wasteland?</Text>
  <Text ID="264881">Looks like we'll have to dig up Sir John Faithful's army o' the dead another day.</Text>
  <Text ID="264882">Shame we couldn't find 'em, I was looking forward to expanding my collection of brass buttons.</Text>
  <Text ID="264883">Lady Faithful's hopes to resurrect her marriage, but Sir John's got cold feet, hehehe.</Text>
  <Text ID="264884">Ice might even have helped preserve the merchandise.</Text>
  <Text ID="264885">I think we all know where Sir John Faithful is now, don't we? (he's dead)</Text>
  <Text ID="264886">I know her old man’s long dead, but his lavish instruments won’t be, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="264887">Don't be afraid to see the frozen look as you frisk their corpses, you’ll get used to it.</Text>
  <Text ID="264888">You can see a body a mile off out here, nice and exposed.</Text>
  <Text ID="264889">Knowing those old toffs, they'd probably skin each other before they'd skin a seal. </Text>
  <Text ID="264890">'I 'spect there's a few nice bits and bobs suspended about the place.</Text>
  <Text ID="264891">Can't always wait til things are dead y'know...</Text>
  <Text ID="264892">No-one'll notice the odd body. If they're well-preserved, we could sell 'em for dissection.</Text>
  <Text ID="264893">Can't believe how much an Inuit'll give ya for a tarnished spoon, hehe.</Text>
  <Text ID="264894">I'd have come before, if I'd known how easy it is to fleece the locals. </Text>
  <Text ID="264895">If you're looking for the Hades and Styx, you're going in the right direction, hehe. </Text>
  <Text ID="264896">We can really milk this predicament for all it's got, as long as we're quiet.</Text>
  <Text ID="264897">Two years in a blizzard probably doesn't do your skin much good, does it?</Text>
  <Text ID="264898">Now, we don't want to look like we're only in it for the proceeds.</Text>
  <Text ID="264899">Now we're onto something. Let's hope for a shipwreck!</Text>
  <Text ID="264900">I hope those ships are stuck fast in the ice, free for the taking!</Text>
  <Text ID="264901">Aren't you wondering what's left of them ships? </Text>
  <Text ID="264905">Blimey, by foot!? This all looks very grim of a sudden, doesn't it?! </Text>
  <Text ID="264906">Afraid? Never seen a real corpse?</Text>
  <Text ID="264908">If Lady Faithful thinks they're still alive let's humour the poor woman's delusion shall we?</Text>
  <Text ID="264909">Let's get to the bottom of this mystery, and what's become of 'em.</Text>
  <Text ID="264910">You'd think you'd seen a ghost, what's frozen yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="264911">Some of them live?! Brings a tear to an old man's eye.</Text>
  <Text ID="264912">Why d'you have to fade away before the final payoff! </Text>
  <Text ID="264913">Heavens what a name, no wonder their luck, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="264914">You seem drawn to death, that's why I stick to you like fishglue.</Text>
  <Text ID="264915">This place is more indifferent to humankind than I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="264916">Cast your eyes about for any tidbits in the snow.</Text>
  <Text ID="264917">Lady Faithful's bewitched, she won't notice if we shuffle off for a bit.</Text>
  <Text ID="264918">A place so curious must have its curiosities…</Text>
  <Text ID="264919">What's all this endeavour of yours for?</Text>
  <Text ID="264920">A lot of furry animals out here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264921">These Inuit are a help though, aren't they? </Text>
  <Text ID="264922">There are times even I give the dead their due.</Text>
  <Text ID="264923">Nothing but bone.</Text>
  <Text ID="264924">A sight to chill even someone as soulless as myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="264925">I think we could all use a tot of hot brandy.</Text>
  <Text ID="264926">Even I'd start to miss the sight of other beings out here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264927">We've come to a place of solitude. </Text>
  <Text ID="264928">I can't bear to watch you do this to yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="264929">We thought you would end icebound too, but for your icebreaker.</Text>
  <Text ID="267204">You can count on that, heheh! The noble old dame belongs to one of the most prosperous families there is.</Text>
  <Text ID="267205">Most likely all those poor mugs indulging her husband are drowned or chewing on their own bones, but like I said, where that much lucre's rolling in, I'll never be far behind! How's about you?</Text>
  <Text ID="267226">Yeah, go on and help the old dame send even more ships to be lost in the nothingness. Looks like you finally found your captain Ahab.</Text>
  <Text ID="267227">Meanwhile, I will set up me own little camp nearby. Just in case you need anything, Ishmael!</Text>
  <Text ID="267241">So you're off to the icy marrow with the old dame, brrr. Don't get lost will yer, guv? You're me best customer!</Text>
  <Text ID="267263">All those ships transmuting into ghosts. And then... silence.</Text>
  <Text ID="266476">There you are. I thought you may have begun without me.</Text>
  <Text ID="266477">But…I’m Old Nate! don’t you recognise me?</Text>
  <Text ID="266478">Don’t do this to me! You know how i love musicals.</Text>
  <Text ID="266479">I know, / a lowly intern painted me / And he was badly paid / I know / I have no proper face / And now I look like a disgrace / I know / A lowly intern cobbled me / While the team just stood and laughed. / I know / for colour there’s no money in the purse / And the midday sun / ensures I look ten times worse </Text>
  <Text ID="266480">Please say, that i am “in”. / My heart it breaks in twain. / And If, i cannot sing, woe! / What will I do then, oh? / Come now, shake my hand!</Text>
  <Text ID="266481">Yeah / I saw the whole thing coming / Now It’s time for me to go. / Dear mother she was a sketching book / And even she loathes how I look</Text>
  <Text ID="255518">Why not share some of my daily hell with you...</Text>
  <Text ID="255519">What I wouldn't give to get out of my shuttered bureau.</Text>
  <Text ID="255520">Guilty until you prove yourself innocent.</Text>
  <Text ID="255522">Think of it as "hard evidence" of your character.</Text>
  <Text ID="255521">I hereby sentence you to not-very-hard labour.</Text>
  <Text ID="255523">See you on the other side.</Text>
  <Text ID="255524">A tiny crack of light.</Text>
  <Text ID="255525">You're getting off lightly.</Text>
  <Text ID="255526">It all looks in order.</Text>
  <Text ID="255527">Case closed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255528">Justice served.</Text>
  <Text ID="255529">Back on the straight and narrow.</Text>
  <Text ID="255530">So, a law-abider!</Text>
  <Text ID="255531">How do you manage to wriggle out of it?</Text>
  <Text ID="255532">You broke the key off in the lock!</Text>
  <Text ID="255533">The scales of justice don't balance themselves!</Text>
  <Text ID="255534">The jury are very much out on you!</Text>
  <Text ID="255535">You will be held accountable!</Text>
  <Text ID="255536">If I must be a good citizen, so must you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255537">You can't escape duty, believe me we've all tried.</Text>
  <Text ID="255538">I know where you live.</Text>
  <Text ID="255539">You're a link in a clanking chain of events...</Text>
  <Text ID="255540">Oh there's no end of work at Her Majesty's pleasure...</Text>
  <Text ID="255541">Are you a glutton for punishment?</Text>
  <Text ID="255542">Don't let them corrupt you too.</Text>
  <Text ID="255543">This is a matter of sovereign law!</Text>
  <Text ID="255544">Have your investigations been fruitful? </Text>
  <Text ID="255545">Ready to bail me out?</Text>
  <Text ID="255546">Coming clean?</Text>
  <Text ID="257238">As quiet now as it'll ever be.</Text>
  <Text ID="257239">No shortage of crims, just a shortage of leads.</Text>
  <Text ID="257240">I don't have anything straightforward.</Text>
  <Text ID="255937">Keep an eye to the horizon for miscreants.</Text>
  <Text ID="255938">It's as bad out there as it is inside.</Text>
  <Text ID="255939">Needless to say an escort must be watchful.</Text>
  <Text ID="259748">To work with the lowest, yet answer only to God and the Queen. How many can say that?</Text>
  <Text ID="259749">Surely the choice is black and white, what with my clean record executing justice.</Text>
  <Text ID="259750">It's not my job to know their crimes, only to find a fitting punishment. </Text>
  <Text ID="259751">Everything seems in order. </Text>
  <Text ID="259752">I see no crime in this.</Text>
  <Text ID="259753">All running like clockwork.</Text>
  <Text ID="259754">Duty has its rewards. </Text>
  <Text ID="259755">A break from hard labour.</Text>
  <Text ID="259756">A light through the bars!</Text>
  <Text ID="259757">No less than is deserved.</Text>
  <Text ID="259758">Excellent.</Text>
  <Text ID="259759">Whatever your methods, you hide them well.</Text>
  <Text ID="259760">You run a tight ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="259761">I attest to your probity.</Text>
  <Text ID="259762">You execute well.</Text>
  <Text ID="259763">Your techniques are efficient.</Text>
  <Text ID="259764">Exemplary conduct.</Text>
  <Text ID="259765">This warrants an inquiry! </Text>
  <Text ID="259766">Someone will hang for this. </Text>
  <Text ID="259767">Criminal. </Text>
  <Text ID="259768">Never would have passed on my watch.</Text>
  <Text ID="259769">Everything, everyone, is suspect.</Text>
  <Text ID="259770">I will raise an injunction!</Text>
  <Text ID="259771">It's misery by proxy. </Text>
  <Text ID="259772">Your negligence is criminal.</Text>
  <Text ID="259773">Careful you don't end up on my island.</Text>
  <Text ID="259774">So you were the perpetrator!</Text>
  <Text ID="259775">If you aren't with me, villain…</Text>
  <Text ID="259776">You tread a very thin line.</Text>
  <Text ID="259777">Fall foul of me, and fall foul of sovereign law.</Text>
  <Text ID="259778">Don't expect to get off scot-free.</Text>
  <Text ID="255398">Tell me you are moral, and not yet another crook-fingered wretch.</Text>
  <Text ID="255399">Her majesty leans on me to detain any who defile her sovereign laws. Including you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256856">What makes you think I trust you?</Text>
  <Text ID="256882">Not everything of yours is out in the open.</Text>
  <Text ID="256883">I'm watching your every move.</Text>
  <Text ID="256884">God scourges those with something to hide.</Text>
  <Text ID="256885">I am the instrument to bear out his judgment.</Text>
  <Text ID="256886">Just how is your conscience?</Text>
  <Text ID="256887">My life is my prison.</Text>
  <Text ID="260922">All the punishments you see are more than justified!</Text>
  <Text ID="260923">Too late to recover these sinners from satan.</Text>
  <Text ID="260924">No way out, and no way in. Well, except through the door.</Text>
  <Text ID="260925">Look at them. Sickening specimens.</Text>
  <Text ID="260926">Don't try and rock the boat.</Text>
  <Text ID="260927">Meticulously drilled, and loyal to the crown.</Text>
  <Text ID="260928">Transportation worse than prison? Don't be so sure!</Text>
  <Text ID="260929">The antithesis of Noah's Ark.</Text>
  <Text ID="259779">Justice served.</Text>
  <Text ID="259780">Community service is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="259781">That's the least I'm due for my suffering.</Text>
  <Text ID="259782">If we must.</Text>
  <Text ID="259783">I permit it.</Text>
  <Text ID="259784">Seems legitimate.</Text>

  <Text ID="255605">I shall keep the receipt.</Text>
  <Text ID="255606">If I find there is anything wrong…</Text>
  <Text ID="255607">Hm. Very Well.</Text>
  <Text ID="255608">This better not be a con!</Text>
  <Text ID="255609">I still don't trust you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255610">Not enough to call it extortion.</Text>
  <Text ID="259787">Not interested.</Text>
  <Text ID="259788">Nix to it!</Text>
  <Text ID="259789">I'm going to have to shut it off.</Text>
  <Text ID="261192">I've no doubt corruption runs in the family, and I'll be watching you closely.</Text>
  <Text ID="261193">Don't drag me into your conspiracy theories. Everybody knows your father was a crook. </Text>
  <Text ID="267901">You don't know what it's like, trying to keep a lid on this jar of rats.</Text>
  <Text ID="267902">Samuel's suicide was his confession. Why are you trying to complicate things?</Text>
  <Text ID="261194">If you weed out a single Pyrphorian you are to bring them to me first for questioning! Is that understood?</Text>
  <Text ID="266603">A shame Edvard never had a taste of real justice.</Text>
  <Text ID="266604">I had been looking forward to putting Edvard's head through the noose. Never mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="266605">Surely there is someone to punish for all of this!?</Text>
  <Text ID="265035">Think turning in sinners maketh you an angel? I know all about your family.</Text>
  <Text ID="265062">Hmm, a delivery? Dead or alive?</Text>
  <Text ID="266227">He is ready for transportation.</Text>
  <Text ID="266229">I can't think why he'd be worth anything - everyone here is beyond redemption…</Text>
  <Text ID="266844">I don't do favours for the children of traitors. Or does that look tell me you're willing to pay…?</Text>
  <Text ID="266845">I'm sure it won't be too long before Edvard contrives to have him back in prison.</Text>
  <Text ID="266846">I don't care why Edvard sent them here. That's his business.</Text>
  <Text ID="266847">Your father's death was a routine suicide. We get them all the time.</Text>
  <Text ID="266848">Nothing in this prison escapes my notice, if there was any funny business with your father's death I'd have known about it!</Text>
  <Text ID="267661">I lick my lips at the prospect of another Goode family tribunal. </Text>
  <Text ID="267666">People who disappoint the monarch often end up with me.</Text>
  <Text ID="267667">And the Queen is going to be there. What a treat.</Text>
  <Text ID="267668">Don't think you will get all the plaudits. Crime is my bag.</Text>
  <Text ID="267669">Your sister is very keen to see justice done. I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that is the case.</Text>
  <Text ID="267670">The problem with public inquiries is everything's out in the open.</Text>
  <Text ID="267671">Imagine serving twenty years in the system, and never getting a sniff of a trial like this.</Text>
  <Text ID="267672">Obviously you'll need my official authorisation of transfer if you want your prisoner brought to the dock!</Text>
  <Text ID="267673">Everything relating to the prison and its prisoners has to go through me!</Text>
  <Text ID="267152">So there you are, the traitor's children!</Text>
  <Text ID="267153">Oh spare me the nauseating drivel! Flogging Queenie's peachy island in the New World to some rebel upstarts?! Traitor is too generous a word!</Text>
  <Text ID="267154">He hung himself in one of my cells. I'd call that a rather conclusive admission of guilt.</Text>
  <Text ID="267155">Oh I vaguely remember him. Stubborn, with a loose mouth, just as innocent as all the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="267156">He is small fry, a bail has been set.</Text>
  <Text ID="267157">Pay every penny of his money and I will place him immediately at your disposal.</Text>
  <Text ID="255547">How about a contract for the Emporium Exotique?</Text>
  <Text ID="255548">An especially exclusive assignment.</Text>
  <Text ID="255549">Not so long ago I'd have dealt with this myself...</Text>
  <Text ID="255550">I can't promise it won't be dangerous.</Text>
  <Text ID="255551">I have need of a fellow professional...</Text>
  <Text ID="255552">Glad you find it exciting.</Text>
  <Text ID="255553">Let me know when you've done the deed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255554">You're keen.</Text>
  <Text ID="255555">The consummate professional.</Text>
  <Text ID="255556">I had a feeling you'd do well.</Text>
  <Text ID="255557">I forget what it's like to have it on my hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="255558">I'd be curious to know your methods.</Text>
  <Text ID="255559">Quick and clean, I'm impressed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255560">The reality of what you had to carry out hit you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255561">You lack the guts to carry it through.</Text>
  <Text ID="255562">Honour is priceless.</Text>
  <Text ID="255563">Consider our connection severed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255564">You have to learn to be ruthless.</Text>
  <Text ID="255565">Take your time.</Text>
  <Text ID="255566">You should put your clients first.</Text>
  <Text ID="255567">I won't teach you to suck eggs.</Text>
  <Text ID="255568">Take a long, deep, breath, and on to the next one.</Text>
  <Text ID="255569">I hope its all not too rich for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255570">Once you get drawn in, it's hard to get out.</Text>
  <Text ID="255571">Later you'll wish you'd done it all differently.</Text>
  <Text ID="255572">I have contacts, remember?</Text>
  <Text ID="255573">Is it done?</Text>
  <Text ID="255574">You have something for me, don't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255575">You can't keep it a secret from me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257241">All is tranquil, thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="257242">As quiet as the afternoon.</Text>
  <Text ID="257243">Nothing going on.</Text>
  <Text ID="257244">Expensive, don't let it go astray.</Text>
  <Text ID="257245">I'd rather not lose that ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="257246">They may strike when we least expect.</Text>
  <Text ID="261196">I may have known your father as a good man, but I don't know you at all.</Text>
  <Text ID="261198">Be careful out there. The rainforest is full of surprises.</Text>
  <Text ID="261199">Justice, revenge — the truth is never black and white.</Text>
  <Text ID="266598">Blow away the shadows, for all our sakes.</Text>
  <Text ID="266599">Ruthless when you had to be, I like that. The world is rid of a great evil.</Text>
  <Text ID="266835">There was a time when I took any opportunity that came my way, just like you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266836">Through all the smoke, I see a glimmer in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266837">Choose your customers, don't let them choose you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266253">The mark of the Pyrphorians. This sign of fire is reserved for those they wish death upon. </Text>
  <Text ID="266254">I never knew your father was mixed up with the Pyrphorians - a grave malevolence.</Text>
  <Text ID="266255">You may be wild, child, but don’t go to the new world, don’t rouse the hornets from their nest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266954">No surprise to hear criminals are drawn here, they go where the money goes.</Text>
  <Text ID="266957">A lot of strange people like to meet in my harbour. That's the nature of the business. </Text>
  <Text ID="266958">Too many shadows to know where one starts and another begins.</Text>
  <Text ID="266959">Don't be stubborn like your father. Stay away from the new world, Prosperity—it is the source of all your troubles.</Text>
  <Text ID="266960">Your father was one of the few honest traders.</Text>
  <Text ID="266961">Your father was a dear friend to me. To think the killer hid himself in my harbour…</Text>
  <Text ID="266962">Smoke rises on the horizon. A threat emerges.</Text>
  <Text ID="266963">Your father was singled out. The Queen's most trusted. I know how these schemes work.</Text>
  <Text ID="266964">The Pyrphorians keep themselves very secret. They may even be watching your every step!</Text>
  <Text ID="266965">The Pyrphorians are an arcane sect. Invisible, yet everywhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="259791">If you're after something unique, you can expect to pay for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="259792">The Emporium Exotique doesn't open its doors to just anyone you know. </Text>
  <Text ID="259793">You're looking for something, and I can help you find it.</Text>
  <Text ID="259794">Isn't that a curiosity. </Text>
  <Text ID="259795">Intriguing.</Text>
  <Text ID="259796">What an exciting turn.</Text>
  <Text ID="259797">This is turning into quite a story. </Text>
  <Text ID="259798">Exhilarating. </Text>
  <Text ID="259799">So, the secret's out.</Text>
  <Text ID="259800">A good outcome. </Text>
  <Text ID="259801">Maybe I was wrong about you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259802">You've got my attention.</Text>
  <Text ID="259803">What a killer instinct. </Text>
  <Text ID="259804">There's merchant in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259805">You can be quite cutthroat. </Text>
  <Text ID="259806">You've rocked the apple cart. </Text>
  <Text ID="259807">I like the way you set out your stall.</Text>
  <Text ID="259808">What a surprise.</Text>
  <Text ID="259809">Just as expected.</Text>
  <Text ID="259810">And life once seemed so thrilling. </Text>
  <Text ID="259811">Typical. </Text>
  <Text ID="259812">What a tangle.</Text>
  <Text ID="259813">I anticipated that.</Text>
  <Text ID="259814">Disappointing.</Text>
  <Text ID="259815">You'll have to do better than that. </Text>
  <Text ID="259816">That's your best offer?</Text>
  <Text ID="259817">Are you wasting my time? </Text>
  <Text ID="259818">You need to be more ruthless. </Text>
  <Text ID="259819">Not much in the way of business sense.</Text>
  <Text ID="259820">I've seen some stupid things…</Text>
  <Text ID="259821">Oh you're not another one of those…</Text>
  <Text ID="255400">The Emporium Exotique looks forward to your patronage - if you can afford it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255401">My curiosities come from far and wide - for the more discerning customer.</Text>
  <Text ID="256857">Welcome to the Emporium Exotique.</Text>
  <Text ID="256888">Sorry if I seem lukewarm.</Text>
  <Text ID="256889">I can tell you're searching for something.</Text>
  <Text ID="256890">Just browsing?</Text>
  <Text ID="256891">I'm here if you need me.</Text>
  <Text ID="256892">Can I help you?</Text>
  <Text ID="256893">Go on then, let's hear your daring tales.</Text>
  <Text ID="260930">I hope you aren't looking for life here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260931">I used to dangle from the eaves of buildings like these.</Text>
  <Text ID="260932">My customers appreciate the tranquility.</Text>
  <Text ID="260933">After everything, I can forgive some peace and quiet.</Text>
  <Text ID="260934">It's wise to be ready to move on, to take change in your stride.</Text>
  <Text ID="260935">My routes crisscross the globe, to ensure I have the best to offer.</Text>
  <Text ID="260936">You don't always need to run a tight ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="260937">Ships don't really interest me.</Text>
  <Text ID="259822">Maybe I should't insist on working alone.</Text>
  <Text ID="259823">I'm grateful but I won't lower my prices.</Text>
  <Text ID="259824">This favour will repay itself in other ways.</Text>
  <Text ID="259825">Interesting, very well. </Text>
  <Text ID="259826">Sounds tempting enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="259827">Agreed. </Text>
  <Text ID="261047">This is a new life for me, I still have luxury, without any of the danger.</Text>
  <Text ID="261049">People see what they want to see. As the years pass, I've learned to play on those assumptions.</Text>
  <Text ID="261050">It's better to hold on to your secrets, I can tell you that for free.</Text>
  <Text ID="261051">I'm expecting a javelin through the back at any moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="261052">Can bad actions have good reasons? I try not to think about it anymore.</Text>
  <Text ID="261048">I don't know if the Queen knows what a burden power over life and death becomes.</Text>
  <Text ID="261053">Archie's mind is a lot sharper than he lets on.</Text>
  <Text ID="261054">Isabel and her people want change, only fools aren't open to that.</Text>
  <Text ID="261055">For Isabel, I'd moonlight again, if only to remember how it feels.</Text>
  <Text ID="261056">Maybe Old Nathaniel doesn't know, but the spirit of the dead lives on in their possessions.</Text>
  <Text ID="261057">Eli thinks everyone has to suffer for justice to be done.</Text>
  <Text ID="261058">Vicente is paranoid I study the book of Judith.</Text>
  <Text ID="255611">I imagine that will that be all?</Text>
  <Text ID="255612">We both hit our targets.</Text>
  <Text ID="255613">You join an elite circle of clients.</Text>
  <Text ID="255614">An exclusive deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="255615">Not the biggest contract I've executed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255616">We both choose our partners carefully.</Text>
  <Text ID="255617">I knew you wouldn't leave disappointed.</Text>
  <Text ID="259828">I'm not interested. </Text>
  <Text ID="259829">My days of risk-taking are over.</Text>
  <Text ID="259830">I might have agreed to that once, not any more.</Text>
  <Text ID="250067">Dream of wide blue horizons? Apply within!</Text>
  <Text ID="250988">Perhaps it'll mean journeying to the centre of the earth!</Text>
  <Text ID="250989">I just know you'll give for a worthy cause!</Text>
  <Text ID="250990">There's fun to be found in everything, even quests!</Text>
  <Text ID="250991">Exploooooore this!</Text>
  <Text ID="250076">We doubled our efforts!</Text>
  <Text ID="250992">I feel better already!</Text>
  <Text ID="250993">You are too kind!</Text>
  <Text ID="250068">It feels special doing a good deed!</Text>
  <Text ID="250994">What can I say but thank you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250995">Upon my stars, I never doubted you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250996">The happiest possible thing!</Text>
  <Text ID="250997">The Jorgensen Trust couldn't be more grateful!</Text>
  <Text ID="250069">Oh really, you're as naughty as the children.</Text>
  <Text ID="250998">It's every person's right to change their mind!</Text>
  <Text ID="250070">Failing is the only way we learn!</Text>
  <Text ID="250999">A lost world! Oh well.</Text>
  <Text ID="251000">Next time will be more than perfect!</Text>
  <Text ID="251001">If the whole business is too much, just say!</Text>
  <Text ID="251002">We should never give up, even when things are really bad!</Text>
  <Text ID="251003">Don't worry, I know you have a fine conscience!</Text>
  <Text ID="251004">I know which summit we can scale next!</Text>
  <Text ID="251005">Such sublime co-operation merits further exploration!</Text>
  <Text ID="251006">So many more miracles to be weaved!</Text>
  <Text ID="251007">There's always another way!</Text>
  <Text ID="251008">It's so nice to have a choice!</Text>
  <Text ID="255406">Oooh please, pick me!</Text>
  <Text ID="253689">Ooh, for me!?</Text>
  <Text ID="253690">The Trust can't wait to see your astonishing work.</Text>
  <Text ID="253691">You're back? Tell me everything!</Text>
  <Text ID="257134">Oh I wish I had something for you!</Text>
  <Text ID="257135">I don't need any help, it's all perfect!</Text>
  <Text ID="257136">I sincerely hope you find work somewhere else!</Text>
  <Text ID="257137">Ready for adventure!?</Text>
  <Text ID="257138">It's a lovely stretch of water!</Text>
  <Text ID="257139">I'm sure no one will bother us!</Text>
  <Text ID="251009">A new world!? I will turn every stone in every stream!</Text>
  <Text ID="251010">Oh yes pick me! We'll explore distant lands, sing songs and press singular flowers! </Text>
  <Text ID="251011">Aren't you just itching to leap into the beyond?</Text>
  <Text ID="251012">A magic carpet ride!</Text>
  <Text ID="251013">I'm over the sky, moon and stars!</Text>
  <Text ID="251014">I am inconceiveably excited!</Text>
  <Text ID="251015">Dashed wonderful!</Text>
  <Text ID="251016">Quite Extraordinary!</Text>
  <Text ID="251017">Splendiferous!</Text>
  <Text ID="251018">Magnifico!</Text>
  <Text ID="251019">You are incomparable!</Text>
  <Text ID="251020">You're wonderful, magical!</Text>
  <Text ID="251021">You're the example to us all!</Text>
  <Text ID="251022">How I knew I could trust you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251023">I want to be exactly like you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251024">You can always be relied upon to do the right thing!</Text>
  <Text ID="251025">You're positively positive!</Text>
  <Text ID="251026">Oh no, how unspeakably awful!</Text>
  <Text ID="251027">A sunny disposition can see me through.</Text>
  <Text ID="251028">It only seems gloomy. </Text>
  <Text ID="251029">This is still a dreadful shock. </Text>
  <Text ID="251030">Only good can come of this, surely.</Text>
  <Text ID="251031">I shouldn't feel bad when there are orphans in the world. </Text>
  <Text ID="251032">I'm sure I can explain this to the trustees. </Text>
  <Text ID="251090">I could never be angry with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251091">You... old fossil. </Text>
  <Text ID="251092">You... dinosaur. </Text>
  <Text ID="251093">I promise I'm not at all cross with you. </Text>
  <Text ID="251094">I'm quite certain you don't mean to offend.</Text>
  <Text ID="251095">I'm trying to put myself in your shoes.</Text>
  <Text ID="251096">You had no choice, I'm absolutely sure. </Text>
  <Text ID="251097">Nice to meet you! I've just returned from my expedition. I'm Bente Jorgensen, chairlady of the Jorgensen Foundation.</Text>
  <Text ID="251098">I'm delighted to meet you! I'm Bente Jorgensen, chairlady of the Jorgensen Foundation. I can't wait to work with you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251099">Oh isn't it a wonderful day?!</Text>
  <Text ID="251100">By Jove hello you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251101">Just finished cataloguing the little butterflies!</Text>
  <Text ID="251102">You simply must want tea!</Text>
  <Text ID="251103">Oh do tell of your adventures!</Text>
  <Text ID="251104">We are so lucky to have a visitor!</Text>
  <Text ID="251105">Funny, I just this minute came through the door myself!</Text>
  <Text ID="251106">The trustees are only too happy to help with town planning!</Text>
  <Text ID="251107">You've unearthed one of my buildings, how fascinating!</Text>
  <Text ID="251108">There's always room for all at my inn!</Text>
  <Text ID="251109">The Jorgensen Trust gives the people the means to help themselves!</Text>
  <Text ID="251110">I'm so grateful to the charitable donations that made this ship possible.</Text>
  <Text ID="251111">What a thrill to adventure upon the open sea!</Text>
  <Text ID="251112">I shall never take the wonder of discovery for granted!</Text>
  <Text ID="251113">Tremendous fun to dispense with dignity, and become a sailor!</Text>
  <Text ID="251114">Bless, bless, bless!</Text>
  <Text ID="251115">I am utterly humbled!</Text>
  <Text ID="251116">Profound thanks on behalf of the Jorgensen Trust.</Text>
  <Text ID="251117">Oh I can't wait!</Text>
  <Text ID="251118">Oh yes, how marvellous!</Text>
  <Text ID="251119">By all means!</Text>
  <Text ID="251120">I wish I could but I can't.</Text>
  <Text ID="251121">Usually I would!</Text>
  <Text ID="251122">Only my advisors disagree!</Text>
  <Text ID="251123">How can display cabinets do justice to the four corners? From Ammonites to Zooplankton we must fire the imagination!</Text>
  <Text ID="251124">I travelled the world with father. He may be gone, but he'd be glad to see my curiosity remains. </Text>
  <Text ID="251125">The Jorgensen Trust only doubt my ability, because they've not see the proposal in full! Profit is no longer the mission, only joy!</Text>
  <Text ID="251126">The Jorgensen dynasty dates back at least as far as the early 15th century. Evidence suggests we are a warm-hearted clan!</Text>
  <Text ID="251127">Read boustrophedon in the dark on a stormy sea, and then tell me anything isn't possible! </Text>
  <Text ID="251128">Oh? I've never seen George grumpy, he's such a caring man with so many remarkable stories!</Text>
  <Text ID="251129">If I could only paint in words like Princess Qing! But we're such good friends I get to hear every poem!</Text>
  <Text ID="260838">I am certain Alonso can be a majestic butterfly, once he emerges from his alarmingly spiny cocoon!</Text>
  <Text ID="260839">Mr Malching sent me a forward proposal. I myself then forwarded it to the fireplace.</Text>
  <Text ID="260840">I'm sure Mr Gasparov's people are as much in love with his designs as he is.</Text>
  <Text ID="260841">I often take tea with Beryl to see how her funny little urchins are getting along.</Text>
  <Text ID="260842">We all know Willie 's silly, but I won't  be the one to say he can't get his act together.</Text>
  <Text ID="260843">I admire how tranquil Lady Margaret is, and after all that has happened to her family.</Text>
  <Text ID="260844">Admiral Vicente does have a very cold sort of laugh.</Text>
  <Text ID="260845">It is emboldening to be among Jean La Fortune's young and aspiring people!</Text>
  <Text ID="260846">I still believe the Jorgensen Trust would be of interest to Her Majesty the Queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="260847">If ever you lack inspiration, seek Sir Archie, he is ever so happy to help!</Text>
  <Text ID="260848">Poor Anne Harlow. It does distress me to see how her star has fallen.</Text>
  <Text ID="260849">Old Nate has a lovely time up in that balloon. Perhaps he could make one for me!</Text>
  <Text ID="260850">I wish I were Isabel. Clever and cunning, and fighting for freedom!</Text>
  <Text ID="260851">I simply love Madame Kahina's shop, I hope it doesn't bother her I never buy anything.</Text>
  <Text ID="260852">I'm sure like so many others, Edvard could have been a good person. </Text>
  <Text ID="260853">Mr. Bleakworth does isolate himself, he should really try and take some fresh air.</Text>
  <Text ID="251130">You just saved my next excursion!</Text>
  <Text ID="251131">Never mind silly money, it's for friendship!</Text>
  <Text ID="251132">See, I can be a good trader!</Text>
  <Text ID="251133">Thank you gentle merchant. </Text>
  <Text ID="251134">I hope that's really helpful!</Text>
  <Text ID="251135">I'm so glad you never cheat me.</Text>
  <Text ID="251136">Wonderful how trade brings people together!</Text>
  <Text ID="251815">You're an erstwhile supporter of the Jorgensen Trust!</Text>
  <Text ID="251816">So many expeditions funded by your trade!</Text>
  <Text ID="251817">Our special trading relationship has saved lives!</Text>
  <Text ID="251294">I hope this agreement agreeable!</Text>
  <Text ID="251295">Ought really to have asked my advisors first!</Text>
  <Text ID="251296">I'm bursting with ideas!</Text>
  <Text ID="251297">This has to be the start of something special!</Text>
  <Text ID="251298">Isn't negotiation thrilling!</Text>
  <Text ID="251299">A wonderful opportunity for change!</Text>
  <Text ID="251300">A proposal!</Text>
  <Text ID="251328">I'm actually quite cross.</Text>
  <Text ID="251329">My advisors don't appear to like you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251330">I learned intimidation from camels.</Text>
  <Text ID="251331">Are you ready for my haka dance?!</Text>
  <Text ID="251338">Oh how fabulous!</Text>
  <Text ID="251342">Extremely generous terms.</Text>
  <Text ID="251343">I mean, if you're absolutely sure…!</Text>
  <Text ID="251344">You've even convinced the board!</Text>
  <Text ID="251345">Ideal for the Jorgensen Trust!</Text>
  <Text ID="251356">No need to sell yourself short!</Text>
  <Text ID="251357">Too generous for me to possibly accept!</Text>
  <Text ID="251358">I think that's too good to be true...</Text>
  <Text ID="251359">For some reason my advisors won't allow it!</Text>
  <Text ID="251360">Oh! The board have put in a veto. </Text>
  <Text ID="256135">Expedition about to leave, must dash.</Text>
  <Text ID="256167">Let's try again when we're fresh!</Text>
  <Text ID="256168">I think we both could use a rest.</Text>
  <Text ID="256169">Enough fun for one day!</Text>
  <Text ID="256170">The trust summons me away, sorry!</Text>
  <Text ID="251378">My clever advisors have adjustments!</Text>
  <Text ID="251379">Good start! My turn!</Text>
  <Text ID="251380">Very little to amend here!</Text>
  <Text ID="251395">I need a little sit down.</Text>
  <Text ID="251396">Yes, of course.</Text>
  <Text ID="251397">But—I'm so nice??</Text>
  <Text ID="251404">Almost fell for that one!</Text>
  <Text ID="251405">Ooh! I'll be just as daring and refuse!</Text>
  <Text ID="251406">Don't be silly! You're not the sort to be malicious!</Text>
  <Text ID="251524">Charity makes me feel all warm inside.</Text>
  <Text ID="251526">Don't mention it!</Text>
  <Text ID="251527">I'm making myself useful!</Text>
  <Text ID="251528">I convinced the board!</Text>
  <Text ID="251529">You are a worthy cause!</Text>
  <Text ID="251535">The board insist!</Text>
  <Text ID="251536">It'll be good in the long run!</Text>
  <Text ID="251537">We should focus on the positives! </Text>
  <Text ID="251538">This is so unlike me.</Text>
  <Text ID="251539">I was outvoted!</Text>
  <Text ID="251540">Lion cubs often have little playfights!</Text>
  <Text ID="251541">I can't believe I'm doing this!</Text>
  <Text ID="251542">I have trust in the board's decision to go to war.</Text>
  <Text ID="251543">Peace begins with a smile.</Text>
  <Text ID="251544">We never really wanted to hurt one another.</Text>
  <Text ID="251546">A break from killing can be nice sometimes. </Text>
  <Text ID="251547">No need to hurt people all of the time!</Text>
  <Text ID="251557">We don't even have to trade, it's just in case... </Text>
  <Text ID="251559">Any opportunity to work together!</Text>
  <Text ID="251560">I just know you'll make a special partner!</Text>
  <Text ID="251575">The Jorgensen trustees annul our trade! </Text>
  <Text ID="251576">We'll trade again soon! </Text>
  <Text ID="251577">I want to do my own thing for a while. </Text>
  <Text ID="251639">We will be so much stronger together!</Text>
  <Text ID="251640">The cherry atop our beautiful friendship-cake!</Text>
  <Text ID="251641">I had no say in this sad sad farewell! </Text>
  <Text ID="251650">The Jorgensen Trust ended our alliance! </Text>
  <Text ID="251678">I want to look after everyone. </Text>
  <Text ID="251679">A thank you for all you've done! </Text>
  <Text ID="251680">A tiny something to keep you going! </Text>
  <Text ID="251753">A lovely surprise!</Text>
  <Text ID="251754">You're ever so dependable!</Text>
  <Text ID="251755">A joy to behold!</Text>
  <Text ID="251756">The Trust will be so pleased!</Text>
  <Text ID="251757">You're too kind.</Text>
  <Text ID="251758">Why so mean?</Text>
  <Text ID="251759">How unexpected.</Text>
  <Text ID="251760">Gasp.</Text>
  <Text ID="251761">Crikey!</Text>
  <Text ID="251762">You musn't!</Text>
  <Text ID="251763">War? Wham, just like that! </Text>
  <Text ID="251764">War? But...I feel suddenly horribly dizzy!</Text>
  <Text ID="251765">You really weren't joking, when you said war...</Text>
  <Text ID="251766">A little ray of sunshine!</Text>
  <Text ID="251767">Wonderful! I live for peace!</Text>
  <Text ID="251768">I'm glad you spared a thought for our poor soldier-y people!</Text>
  <Text ID="251769">With this, we are one step closer to peace! </Text>
  <Text ID="251770">Trade is vital to opening cultural dialogues.</Text>
  <Text ID="251771">A major partner like you will delight the board. </Text>
  <Text ID="251772">Now we both benefit from each others' charity!</Text>
  <Text ID="251773">I didn't think it would end so soon!</Text>
  <Text ID="251774">Oh, well a change is as good as a rest!</Text>
  <Text ID="251775">That's not what I'd bargained on!</Text>
  <Text ID="251780">You mean we weren't allies already?!</Text>
  <Text ID="251781">No need to be so formal, of course I accept!</Text>
  <Text ID="251782">I think we all like to be on our own sometimes.</Text>
  <Text ID="251783">I shall treasure the time we had as friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="251790">What a selfless act of charity!</Text>
  <Text ID="251791">All proceeds go directly to the Trust!</Text>
  <Text ID="251796">Oh! Don't think I've ever come across one of those...</Text>
  <Text ID="251797">I always dreamed of becoming young and naïve!</Text>
  <Text ID="251798">You are one of the funniest people I know.</Text>
  <Text ID="251799">Hats are terribly fun to make fun of!</Text>
  <Text ID="251800">I should be delighted to change the subject!</Text>
  <Text ID="251801">Oh, how extraordinarily specific! </Text>
  <Text ID="251802">Gallantry can be embarassing...</Text>
  <Text ID="251803">I like to fill awkward silences by talking.</Text>
  <Text ID="251804">That's very clear advice.</Text>
  <Text ID="251805">My advisors say that too.</Text>
  <Text ID="251806">I won't be looking that up in the dictionary. </Text>
  <Text ID="251807">You're right, butter does melt in my mouth!</Text>
  <Text ID="251808">Oh yes, I am a bit of a gigglemug.</Text>
  <Text ID="251809">So sweet of you to say! Even if others are twice as generous! </Text>
  <Text ID="251810">You're right it was a challenging waterfall! I should probably allow myself a pat on the back. </Text>
  <Text ID="251811">Well I do make a point of learning about other cultures - other human beings!</Text>
  <Text ID="254781">Didn't think I'd forgotten you did you!</Text>
  <Text ID="254796">We can be the most fabulous friends!</Text>
  <Text ID="254797">I'm still so excited for us!</Text>
  <Text ID="254798">Still so many adventures out there for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="254799">I try to like people a little more every day.</Text>
  <Text ID="254800">It gladdens me to be reminded of your positivity!</Text>
  <Text ID="254801">I'm a happy person, you're a happy person!</Text>
  <Text ID="254802">There's a charitable heart in there, I'm sure of it!</Text>
  <Text ID="254782">Hurts terribly when friendships fade.</Text>
  <Text ID="254803">I feel awful about us losing touch!</Text>
  <Text ID="254804">I'd hoped to be on best terms with everyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="254805">There is a noble heart in you somewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="254806">I'll always think the best of you, really I will.</Text>
  <Text ID="254807">I've been so busy with the Trust and soforth!</Text>
  <Text ID="254808">I for one won't stop believing in our being friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="254809">So sad when good friends drift apart. </Text>
  <Text ID="265514">Seems like you two are getting along! </Text>
  <Text ID="265515">Isn't it nice when people are pleasant to one another? </Text>
  <Text ID="265517">And they say I can be pleasant with anyone… </Text>
  <Text ID="265518">There's good in everyone, but here I must look hard to see it…</Text>
  <Text ID="265520">Why can't we all just be friends?</Text>
  <Text ID="265521">It would be wrong not to stand by my  companion in this.</Text>
  <Text ID="265523">You can't please everyone. Believe me, I've tried. </Text>
  <Text ID="265524">Sometimes it's hard not to let one's feeling show.... </Text>
  <Text ID="265516">It makes me sad to know my friends are being deceived.</Text>
  <Text ID="265519">You're not trying to trick people are you?</Text>
  <Text ID="265522">I don't normally like dishonesty... </Text>
  <Text ID="265525">As long as there's nothing criminal involved. </Text>
  <Text ID="256659">Oh yes, forget about silly old us!</Text>
  <Text ID="256660">Your people seem so sophisticated!</Text>
  <Text ID="256661">We're happy to be left behind!</Text>
  <Text ID="256664">Yes, don't trail behind me out of politeness!</Text>
  <Text ID="256665">Your people have great potential!</Text>
  <Text ID="256666">You'll be advancing again in no time!</Text>
  <Text ID="256669">Now you've got more islands than me!</Text>
  <Text ID="256670">I suppose expansion is always good.</Text>
  <Text ID="256671">Amazing you know what to do with them all.</Text>
  <Text ID="257037">I see you're exploring yet more islands!</Text>
  <Text ID="257038">As long as you preserve what's already there!</Text>
  <Text ID="256672">You'll be spreading out again in no time, I'm sure!</Text>
  <Text ID="256673">See, a whole world waits for us to explore!</Text>
  <Text ID="256674">That's it old bean, spread out!</Text>
  <Text ID="257039">I've probably settled too many islands!</Text>
  <Text ID="257040">If I can expand, you most certainly can!</Text>
  <Text ID="251836">I just want to show how much I believe in you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251837">The Jorgensen Trust only invests in worthy causes!</Text>
  <Text ID="251838">Co-operation is the key to success!</Text>
  <Text ID="251839">It's really up to the Trustees as to whether the island will be taken over...</Text>
  <Text ID="251840">The Trustees say whatever we do will be in your interest!</Text>
  <Text ID="251842">Thank you for the vote of confidence.</Text>
  <Text ID="251843">Must be you want to finance the museum.</Text>
  <Text ID="251844">Doing your bit for charity, are you?</Text>
  <Text ID="251845">I'm sure you'd do a much better job with the place than I!</Text>
  <Text ID="251846">The Jorgensen Trustees are uneasy about the future of the island.</Text>
  <Text ID="251847">So good of you to save a secret garden just for me!</Text>
  <Text ID="251848">Such impressive foliage! And I have you to thank.</Text>
  <Text ID="251851">Every penny from auction goes to the Jorgensen Trust!</Text>
  <Text ID="251852">Please, do something wonderful with it!</Text>
  <Text ID="251855">My old island seems so desolate now.</Text>
  <Text ID="251856">All the work of the Jorgensen Trust has been undone.</Text>
  <Text ID="251857">All my efforts on that island have gone to waste. </Text>
  <Text ID="251858">You can take all the credit for any finds I make here?</Text>
  <Text ID="251859">Startling brush-footed butterflies! Please allow me the chance to study them?</Text>
  <Text ID="251860">This would be an excellent spot for a base camp?</Text>
  <Text ID="251915">I wish we wouldn't fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="251916">I've turned into a monster!</Text>
  <Text ID="251917">This is awful.</Text>
  <Text ID="251918">I hope you're happy. </Text>
  <Text ID="251919">I'm going mad!</Text>
  <Text ID="251965">You must have no joy in your life.</Text>
  <Text ID="251966">Did you fire by mistake?</Text>
  <Text ID="251967">What of charity?</Text>
  <Text ID="251968">I'm an easy target, after all!</Text>
  <Text ID="251969">I suppose I am one of the weakest.</Text>
  <Text ID="251980">This never needed to happen!</Text>
  <Text ID="251981">Did I really do that?!</Text>
  <Text ID="251982">Totally out of character, I assure you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251983">That was paid for from a children's fund.</Text>
  <Text ID="251984">Those poor sailors!</Text>
  <Text ID="251985">You must feel terrible.</Text>
  <Text ID="251986">This isn't who I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="251987">Please, don't blame me.</Text>
  <Text ID="251989">To destroy is so much easier than to create!</Text>
  <Text ID="251990">Was it so ugly that it had to come down?</Text>
  <Text ID="251994">A part of me I never wanted to explore.</Text>
  <Text ID="251995">These feelings terrify me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252089">I don't think this will be the end of your tyranny.</Text>
  <Text ID="252090">Perhaps you'll be depriving children of their warm blankets next?</Text>
  <Text ID="251997">It's simply unbearable to have to do away with someone who should have been a friend! </Text>
  <Text ID="252044">You merciless, tyrannical, thuggish, brute. Why am I so nice, when I should have been selfish, and cut off your head?</Text>
  <Text ID="252045">You could have talked things through…</Text>
  <Text ID="252046">Do you have no regard for life?</Text>
  <Text ID="252047">Still a tragedy, though we never saw eye-to-eye.</Text>
  <Text ID="252048">I still wouldn't wish that on anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="252049">You want to protect what is dear to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252050">Most species have some form of defence.</Text>
  <Text ID="252051">Back against the wall, I might do the same.</Text>
  <Text ID="252052">It is instinct to want to shield our families. </Text>
  <Text ID="252075">I'm sure you have reasons.</Text>
  <Text ID="252076">The advisory board is impressed by your might.</Text>
  <Text ID="252077">I didn't know you liked fighting.</Text>
  <Text ID="252078">I try not to think about conflict.</Text>
  <Text ID="261141">There's been a dreadful misunderstanding, it's now I need your support most.</Text>
  <Text ID="261142">Perhaps you can convince them; all I want is peace!</Text>
  <Text ID="252079">Help, I have declared war on your ally! Sorry to put you on the spot... </Text>
  <Text ID="252081">Why of course I'll defend you, just as you would me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252082">I'm not sure how much help I'll be, but I'll try! </Text>
  <Text ID="252083">Now you see they are living creatures, I'm certain you'll stop this senseless war!</Text>
  <Text ID="252084">You don't have to burn them all to the ground you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="252085">Perhaps seeing them suffer up close can convince you to get the help you need.</Text>
  <Text ID="252086">Before the war began, these adventurers were filled with hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="252087">I'm not sure if my sailors are as violent as yours.</Text>
  <Text ID="252088">Ships aren't only for killing, as I'm sure you already know.</Text>
  <Text ID="255940">They must not know you as I do.</Text>
  <Text ID="255941">But you're never mean to them, are you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255946">There we are, all better!</Text>
  <Text ID="255949">With you as nurse, I knew they'd get well soon!</Text>
  <Text ID="255944">I love the fire service, they help me a lot!</Text>
  <Text ID="255951">So brave, and so many lives saved!</Text>
  <Text ID="256693">You're trying to scare us!</Text>
  <Text ID="256694">How frightening you can be!</Text>
  <Text ID="256695">Most people would try to calm things down!</Text>
  <Text ID="256702">Is everyone really as happy as you say?</Text>
  <Text ID="256703">How wonderful that your people are so satisfied. </Text>
  <Text ID="256704">Hmmn. Your people didn't seem that happy.</Text>
  <Text ID="264949">Treading paths never trodden!</Text>
  <Text ID="264950">The thrill of discovering new horizons…!</Text>
  <Text ID="265713">Something must have been lost in translation…</Text>
  <Text ID="265715">Fancy fighting with an old gent like George.</Text>
  <Text ID="265716">But Beryl has always been so kind to me...</Text>
  <Text ID="265719">The world has been nothing but cruel to Alonso.</Text>
  <Text ID="265721">Poor lady Margaret, hasn't she been through enough in her life…?</Text>
  <Text ID="265725">You'll soon discover Princess Qing regales the most fascinating tales!</Text>
  <Text ID="265727">George will say he doesn't want any help, but please take good care of him.</Text>
  <Text ID="265728">Beryl's tea parties are always a very great comfort!</Text>
  <Text ID="265731">I am so glad you've seen Alonso's gentle side.</Text>
  <Text ID="265733">I always worry about dear old Maggs, good to know she has a friend.</Text>
  <Text ID="267878">What a wonderful display of different species, all living in harmony.</Text>
  <Text ID="267879">So much to be gleaned in that marvellous museum! </Text>
  <Text ID="267880">Oh my, what tragedy for your island's natural habitat… </Text>
  <Text ID="267881">What a revolutionary way to resolve unemployment! </Text>
  <Text ID="267882">Nothing warms my heart like all those  happy little smiles.</Text>
  <Text ID="267883">They must  love you so much!</Text>
  <Text ID="267884">Not many are brave enough to show such empathy! </Text>
  <Text ID="267885">Your compassion for your people is admirable!</Text>
  <Text ID="267886">A beautiful city is a reflection of a beautiful soul! </Text>
  <Text ID="267887">I thought I'd have to cross the globe to see such wonders!</Text>
  <Text ID="267888">I can't wait to hear what stories they have to tell! </Text>
  <Text ID="267889">What have they brought back? Oh, it feels like Christmas morning!</Text>
  <Text ID="267890">Don't be discouraged, the journey is itself to be treasured.</Text>
  <Text ID="267891">It will turn out better next time!</Text>
  <Text ID="261136">When loved ones pass away, it helps to keep yourself occupied with joyful things!</Text>
  <Text ID="261137">I knew the moment we met, the jolly royal council would come around to you!</Text>
  <Text ID="267907">Murder? Why it's unthinkable!</Text>
  <Text ID="267908">I hear you're going on an expedition for the Queen, how tremendous!</Text>
  <Text ID="261138">I for one hope you uncover proof of your father's innocence!</Text>
  <Text ID="261140">If you need counsel during the trial, my door is always open.</Text>
  <Text ID="266573">Fight the Pyrphorians with love! They will beg you to stop!</Text>
  <Text ID="266574">I feel sorry for the Pyrphorians. What drives people to be like that?</Text>
  <Text ID="261209">This isn't the nice sort of surprise is it? </Text>
  <Text ID="261356">You're not involved in the mafia, are you? </Text>
  <Text ID="261357">It seems I had unexpected visitors! </Text>
  <Text ID="261358">Maybe I shouldn't go away so often…</Text>
  <Text ID="261359">I'm sure you knew nothing about these creeps.</Text>
  <Text ID="261210">I admit, a mafia is not very Jorgensen. </Text>
  <Text ID="261360">It must have been the trustees.</Text>
  <Text ID="261361">But surely you don't think I would ever…?</Text>
  <Text ID="261362">Say you haven't lost trust in the Trust?</Text>
  <Text ID="261363">Oh why are my trustees such awful people!</Text>
  <Text ID="261212">You and I share lifelong passions for discovery!</Text>
  <Text ID="261364">You are dreaming up a brighter future!</Text>
  <Text ID="261365">Hurrah for science!</Text>
  <Text ID="261214">Your researches make me jump.</Text>
  <Text ID="261366">Your finger is very firmly on the pulse. </Text>
  <Text ID="261367">Isn't it all a bit sudden?</Text>
  <Text ID="266415">Of course there is! I told you, we’re late!</Text>
  <Text ID="266416">No, only in 2D! They went and splurged the entire emergency budget on sausages for the Anno Union.</Text>
  <Text ID="266417">Are you crazy? No! We see this through! And stop calling me Tanya, I’m Bente— stay in character!</Text>
  <Text ID="266418">"Ladies and Gentlemen! A very warm welcome to the dress rehearsal of ""The Jørgensens - The Musical"""</Text>
  <Text ID="266419">Nope. I gave the libretto some welcome revision last night.</Text>
  <Text ID="266420">—And what, grandpa? Get with the program. The Anno series has its best moments behind it. The Jørgensens, on the other hand, are rising stars in the strategy universe. Rumour has it Ubisoft already plans a whole new franchise, with me at the helm.</Text>
  <Text ID="266421">How many times? It’s Bente, not Tanya, thickie!</Text>
  <Text ID="266422">With the teensy difference we lack the pink tutu.</Text>
  <Text ID="266423">Too much info!</Text>
  <Text ID="266424">Shut up already!</Text>
  <Text ID="266425">I think we get it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266426">We did. when archie says her majesty he means…</Text>
  <Text ID="266427">You are the nine / The only one / Without whom / We would feel so small</Text>
  <Text ID="266428">I did not believe / Thought it was a ruse / mistook for blasphemy / the obvious truth.</Text>
  <Text ID="266429">To be honest, none, your majesty.</Text>
  <Text ID="266430">Who, or better, what are you?</Text>
  <Text ID="266431">I’m sorry Nathaniel, but in this condition it is impossible for you to take part.</Text>
  <Text ID="266432">No, just no.</Text>
  <Text ID="266433">You’re telling me! An evening of anno takes forever. Luckily most of us fast forward.</Text>
  <Text ID="266434">Simply just fast forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266435">They all fast-forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266436">We fast forward, and forward…</Text>
  <Text ID="266437">Oh what now?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266438">No portrait, nothing , only a colour? He is not allowed to join!</Text>
  <Text ID="266439">You can’t play with us! / You are player blue, / But no-one really gets to know you</Text>
  <Text ID="266440">This is becoming ridiculous.</Text>
  <Text ID="266441">Shut it!</Text>
  <Text ID="266442">Damn thing!</Text>
  <Text ID="266443">It’s much too soon for me to be through!</Text>
  <Text ID="266444">Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.</Text>
  <Text ID="252947">They who wish to grow, must themselves grow others…</Text>
  <Text ID="252948">Are you permitted to serve one such as I?</Text>
  <Text ID="252949">Filial duties weigh heavy, can you share my burden? </Text>
  <Text ID="252950">Will you bring order to the scattered cosmos?</Text>
  <Text ID="252951">Perhaps you, are a dragon among mortals?</Text>
  <Text ID="252952">There is nothing like trying.</Text>
  <Text ID="252953">The chill already thaws.</Text>
  <Text ID="252954">Fly upon a cloud.</Text>
  <Text ID="252955">You have shown Xin; integrity. </Text>
  <Text ID="252956">Sweet rain after the long drought.</Text>
  <Text ID="252957">A mind as fine as jade.</Text>
  <Text ID="252958">My family extends its warmest appreciation.</Text>
  <Text ID="252959">From decay you sprout a blush of lotus.</Text>
  <Text ID="252960">Your celestial aura fades.</Text>
  <Text ID="252961">Some people fish, others disturb the water.</Text>
  <Text ID="252962">I know what it is like, not meeting expectations.</Text>
  <Text ID="252963">A square peg in a round hole?</Text>
  <Text ID="252964">The lean horse dies beside an ancient road.</Text>
  <Text ID="252965">Firewood must gather before the sun dies.</Text>
  <Text ID="252966">Only practice can make art.</Text>
  <Text ID="252967">Is it impolite, to ask if you have finished?</Text>
  <Text ID="252968">Carp must leap over the dragon gate.</Text>
  <Text ID="252969">Can the expended hen lay one more egg?</Text>
  <Text ID="252970">Can you dip your brush once more?</Text>
  <Text ID="252971">Loyalty is an important precept.</Text>
  <Text ID="252972">Do that which is virtuous.</Text>
  <Text ID="255407">Your artistry has borne fruit?</Text>
  <Text ID="255408">Has autumn's harvest come?</Text>
  <Text ID="255409">Do the leaves rustle the rumour of success?</Text>
  <Text ID="257140">There was something I wanted to ask of you—I will try to remember.</Text>
  <Text ID="257141">Your help is always very welcome, but I have no desires.</Text>
  <Text ID="257142">Something you could do for me? I will think about that.</Text>
  <Text ID="257143">Do east and west stand side by side?</Text>
  <Text ID="257144">Are you kind enough to give me the tour?</Text>
  <Text ID="257145">Do I have the privilege of a royal guard?</Text>
  <Text ID="261144">I see. You have come home to great responsibility, and I have left home with it. </Text>
  <Text ID="261145">I am also keen to work with the Queen. Perhaps one day you will help arrange a meeting?</Text>
  <Text ID="267913">My father too courts the attention of assassins. Not so much my mother.</Text>
  <Text ID="267914">Preparing to go to another world? This one is already too much for me!</Text>
  <Text ID="261146">Isabel's rebellion I think, is the first I understand. But the Pyrphorian danger is greatly to be feared.</Text>
  <Text ID="261147">I am very curious to see your legal process in action!</Text>
  <Text ID="266579">Shades pour from the earth! We will be overrun!</Text>
  <Text ID="266580">Two tattered flowers showered with tears give life to a meadowfull.</Text>
  <Text ID="252973">If it is customary for you to have guests, then I would be quite curious.</Text>
  <Text ID="252974">The Emperor and Empress also wish that I join you in strange lands.</Text>
  <Text ID="252975">If I am commissioned, I will paint you a story in broad strokes.</Text>
  <Text ID="252976">It is outwardly pleasing.</Text>
  <Text ID="252977">Such beauty. </Text>
  <Text ID="252978">Fragrance follows rain. </Text>
  <Text ID="252979">The crab sidles in harmony. </Text>
  <Text ID="252980">Descended from heaven.</Text>
  <Text ID="252981">It is a pretty picture.</Text>
  <Text ID="252982">Joyful tidings. </Text>
  <Text ID="252983">You ennoble your ancestors.</Text>
  <Text ID="252984">Your conduct is exemplary. </Text>
  <Text ID="252985">You show Jìng; a reverence.  </Text>
  <Text ID="252986">You are a superior person.</Text>
  <Text ID="252987">You have done more by saying less.</Text>
  <Text ID="252988">You are kind. </Text>
  <Text ID="252989">You are careful.</Text>
  <Text ID="252990">I feel chǐ; the burden of shame. </Text>
  <Text ID="252991">It is a millstone around my neck.</Text>
  <Text ID="252992">I fear I bring shame upon my ancestors.</Text>
  <Text ID="252993">Is this feeling disgrace?</Text>
  <Text ID="252994">These hardships do not feel heroic. </Text>
  <Text ID="252995">I am afraid I am a disappointment.</Text>
  <Text ID="252996">I fear I do not represent my people well.</Text>
  <Text ID="252997">My impression of you is unfavourable. </Text>
  <Text ID="252998">You are a confusion.</Text>
  <Text ID="252999">Are you a preacher of falsehoods? </Text>
  <Text ID="253000">A heart that is rotten; breath that smells.</Text>
  <Text ID="253001">Are you the cause of endless sorrow?</Text>
  <Text ID="253002">Your ways seem fickle and foreign. </Text>
  <Text ID="253003">I see you have little reverence. </Text>
  <Text ID="253004">I am Heshuo Princess Qing, my father and mother send me as an ambassador.</Text>
  <Text ID="253005">I am the Princess Qing. Please, I am curious about your otherworldly customs.</Text>
  <Text ID="253006">Is it duty that bring you here, or pleasure?</Text>
  <Text ID="253007">Spring and Autumn, Summer and Winter.</Text>
  <Text ID="253008">This is the outer ocean, far from what is known.</Text>
  <Text ID="253009">Incense burns in my brazier for your arrival.</Text>
  <Text ID="253010">You have waded snowdrifts to come here. </Text>
  <Text ID="253011">I comb and brood, the livelong day.</Text>
  <Text ID="253012">My calligraphy smudges with tears of doubt.</Text>
  <Text ID="253013">I see nostalgic valleys of flowers, yet cannot touch them.</Text>
  <Text ID="253014">We each hold a tiny world in this dream.</Text>
  <Text ID="253015">I sit among familiar willow, as I pluck the Guzheng in yearning.</Text>
  <Text ID="253016">When I believe a tree is one I know, I see the bird within it is not.</Text>
  <Text ID="253017">We have been too hesitant towards the sea. </Text>
  <Text ID="253018">Is this sea not gilded by desert sand? </Text>
  <Text ID="253019">Should I fear for pirates?</Text>
  <Text ID="253020">Water may float a boat, but can sink it also.</Text>
  <Text ID="253021">I bow deeply.</Text>
  <Text ID="253022">My family is honoured.</Text>
  <Text ID="253023">Affection falls upon grateful ears.</Text>
  <Text ID="253024">Most convenient.</Text>
  <Text ID="253025">I see the virtue in it.</Text>
  <Text ID="253026">It is fitting.</Text>
  <Text ID="253027">It is not permitted.</Text>
  <Text ID="253028">Regrettably, I must refuse.</Text>
  <Text ID="253029">It would be shameful.</Text>
  <Text ID="253030">My father is Emperor. A life of privilege, tinged with sadness and regret.</Text>
  <Text ID="253031">I drop my weaving like Mulan, and take saddle to this black mountain of business. I can only fail.</Text>
  <Text ID="253032">The rivers and mountains do not threaten, and glimpses of home lie among them. But there is no hiding behind fans.</Text>
  <Text ID="253033">The sky is big, and the Emperor far away, yet I long for the palace of crimson hibiscus.</Text>
  <Text ID="253034">I would establish a literary salon, but who to ask for its blessing? How should I begin?</Text>
  <Text ID="260854">I always adored the rambling talk of travelling ambassadors - be careful what you wish for. </Text>
  <Text ID="260855">My mother the Empress would have me carry out her orders instead. But I cannot, I cannot...</Text>
  <Text ID="253035">Miss Bente Jorgensen helps me forget. She is a day-lily, I cherish her joy.</Text>
  <Text ID="253036">Mr Willie Wibblesock enjoys pure talk, but is no literatus. Maybe he is a nuisance.</Text>
  <Text ID="253037">I composed Mr. George Smith an octet on the chysanthemum - for a peaceful retirement.</Text>
  <Text ID="253044">At our first audience, the Queen would not say how my poetry was received.</Text>
  <Text ID="253038">The Queen has the mandate of heaven.</Text>
  <Text ID="253039">Mr Malching has sympathy for commerce, and no sympathy otherwise.</Text>
  <Text ID="253040">I think Mr Graves to be a jiangshi, lusting after flesh.</Text>
  <Text ID="253041">General Vicente Silva bristles with blue feathers from the raven's tail.</Text>
  <Text ID="253042">Lady Margaret has lived long, and her wisdom cannot be challenged.</Text>
  <Text ID="253043">I admire Sir Blake's passion of woodwork, but how will it serve his Queen?</Text>
  <Text ID="253045">Mr Bleakworth might wear an aubergine hat. He is very officious.</Text>
  <Text ID="253047">Should we not have shook upon it? </Text>
  <Text ID="253048">Was this good business?</Text>
  <Text ID="253049">I am glad it is sealed.</Text>
  <Text ID="253050">You are shrewd.</Text>
  <Text ID="253051">The golden river flows.</Text>
  <Text ID="253052">The ritual is over.</Text>
  <Text ID="253053">For your trade, I sincerely thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="253205">You are loyal. We have traded many times.</Text>
  <Text ID="253206">Trading, we are dragon and phoenix in happy union.</Text>
  <Text ID="253207">I have learned a great deal about trade from you.</Text>
  <Text ID="253068">May we trace the paths of the sages?</Text>
  <Text ID="253069">I believe engagement important.</Text>
  <Text ID="253070">Are you open to possibility?</Text>
  <Text ID="253071">I paint with a broad brush at first.</Text>
  <Text ID="253072">I offer gestures of goodwill.</Text>
  <Text ID="253073">I am investigating the way you conduct diplomacy.</Text>
  <Text ID="253074">Can we bridge east and west?</Text>
  <Text ID="253075">I do not care to understand you.</Text>
  <Text ID="253076">I will not be disgraced.</Text>
  <Text ID="253077">It is worth the consequences.</Text>
  <Text ID="253078">My family will not be dishonoured.</Text>
  <Text ID="253079">Beautiful beyond words.</Text>
  <Text ID="253080">I accept this odd contract.</Text>
  <Text ID="253081">A sage proposal.</Text>
  <Text ID="253082">Sweet apricot rain.</Text>
  <Text ID="253083">Like water on hot stone.</Text>
  <Text ID="253084">It is ill-judged.</Text>
  <Text ID="253085">It does not turn my head.</Text>
  <Text ID="253086">Alas, I cannot accept.</Text>
  <Text ID="253087">It is not at all what I am used to</Text>
  <Text ID="253088">I fear I must wade upriver.</Text>
  <Text ID="256136">To continue, is not in our mutual interest.</Text>
  <Text ID="256171">You drive even a patient mind to despair.</Text>
  <Text ID="256172">There is no harmony here.</Text>
  <Text ID="256173">My strategies do not seem to be working.</Text>
  <Text ID="256174">I'm not sure we'll ever understand each other.</Text>
  <Text ID="253089">A mountain cannot turn, but a road can.</Text>
  <Text ID="253090">Perhaps there is another path.</Text>
  <Text ID="253091">In art, I value attention to detail.</Text>
  <Text ID="253092">The small flower wilts under heavy dew.</Text>
  <Text ID="253093">Orchids yield to frost, hoping for spring.</Text>
  <Text ID="253094">Water can only weep when taken from its well.</Text>
  <Text ID="253095">No, barbarian.</Text>
  <Text ID="253096">I will not be tainted by your ways.</Text>
  <Text ID="253097">I will not be corrupted.</Text>
  <Text ID="253098">Is this customary?</Text>
  <Text ID="253099">Do you take tea?</Text>
  <Text ID="253100">Clear waters.</Text>
  <Text ID="253101">Let us cultivate virtue.</Text>
  <Text ID="253102">May we grow and live long.</Text>
  <Text ID="253103">I fear I must…</Text>
  <Text ID="253104">Anything is better than shame.</Text>
  <Text ID="253105">I am sorry for our differences.</Text>
  <Text ID="253106">It is very hard for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="253107">An atmosphere of mistrust…</Text>
  <Text ID="253108">Dragon against tiger!</Text>
  <Text ID="253109">I will die for my family!</Text>
  <Text ID="253110">I will paint you the art of war!</Text>
  <Text ID="253111">Will the apple of peace tempt you?</Text>
  <Text ID="253112">I only wish us long life.</Text>
  <Text ID="253113">Will the apple of peace tempt you?</Text>
  <Text ID="253114">I only wish us long life.</Text>
  <Text ID="253115">Branches of one elm, are we not?</Text>
  <Text ID="253116">Are you open to trade? </Text>
  <Text ID="253117">Show me how you conduct your business?</Text>
  <Text ID="253118">Who can stop leaves from falling?</Text>
  <Text ID="253119">I long to throw off the duties of a worldly life.</Text>
  <Text ID="253120">Promises in the snow melt away.</Text>
  <Text ID="253125">I wish to spread harmony.</Text>
  <Text ID="253126">A marriage of earth and heaven.</Text>
  <Text ID="253127">Three monks have no water to drink.</Text>
  <Text ID="253128">We are all out of balance.</Text>
  <Text ID="253135">Do you call it "altruism"?</Text>
  <Text ID="253136">A scattering of blossom.</Text>
  <Text ID="253137">I hope you don't disapprove of gift-giving.</Text>
  <Text ID="253143">Pure as lone bamboo.</Text>
  <Text ID="253144">I sit at ease.</Text>
  <Text ID="253145">Auspicious clouds…</Text>
  <Text ID="253146">You interpret 'the way' well…</Text>
  <Text ID="253147">A pleasing custom.</Text>
  <Text ID="253148">It is unethical.</Text>
  <Text ID="253149">Resentment.</Text>
  <Text ID="253150">You would exploit?</Text>
  <Text ID="253151">It is immoral.</Text>
  <Text ID="253152">Sadness.</Text>
  <Text ID="253153">It is barbaric!</Text>
  <Text ID="253154">You have a machine heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="253155">The moon at the fortified pass...</Text>
  <Text ID="253156">No country benefits from long wars.</Text>
  <Text ID="253157">Let us rinse our cups and taste fresh tea.</Text>
  <Text ID="253158">Silkworms may yet hang upon their frames.</Text>
  <Text ID="253159">Without reflection, we are nothing but beasts.</Text>
  <Text ID="253160">It is good manners to agree terms of trade.</Text>
  <Text ID="253161">With such connections may I meet expectations.</Text>
  <Text ID="253162">A new-style poem of shared prosperity.</Text>
  <Text ID="253163">A discarded autumn fan… </Text>
  <Text ID="253164">Such dissolution is to my family's shame. </Text>
  <Text ID="253165">Has my etiquette failed me?</Text>
  <Text ID="253170">Then we are plum and bamboo together.</Text>
  <Text ID="253171">Your heart is white jade, unblemished.</Text>
  <Text ID="253172">Then we lose the bond of friend-to-friend…</Text>
  <Text ID="253173">Mountains move so suddenly, and terribly.</Text>
  <Text ID="253180">Is it not customary to give something in return?</Text>
  <Text ID="253181">I am grateful fo your faith in my business.</Text>
  <Text ID="253186">But that is precisely the advantage of chopsticks.</Text>
  <Text ID="253187">The angry monk paddles alone down the river.</Text>
  <Text ID="253188">Do you not hold a lantern to your own eccentricities?</Text>
  <Text ID="253189">Oh, a compliment! For a moment I thought you were being rude...</Text>
  <Text ID="253190">Does the local wine urge itself upon you?</Text>
  <Text ID="253191">I think I may skip this particular lecture.</Text>
  <Text ID="253192">Is it not forbidden to express such things?</Text>
  <Text ID="253193">But white flowers are symbols of death!</Text>
  <Text ID="253194">Yes, my calligraphy could be more fluent. I will try harder.</Text>
  <Text ID="253195">Perhaps I am not as modest as I think myself to be. </Text>
  <Text ID="253196">I am very far from sharing my family ambitions, it is true. </Text>
  <Text ID="253197">You remind me that I am but a lowly child of the Emperor. </Text>
  <Text ID="253198">Then you know of the three perfections?</Text>
  <Text ID="253199">Moth eyebrows? Then you know how to appreciate beauty.</Text>
  <Text ID="253200">Recited for me? I am transported home, to blossom and narcissus.</Text>
  <Text ID="253201">I never thought a foreigner could begin to know me.</Text>
  <Text ID="254784">You may climb mountains yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="254810">Your willow may yet offer shelter.</Text>
  <Text ID="254811">Your river still winds to a sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="254812">Affection can be timeless.</Text>
  <Text ID="254813">My family hold you in high esteem.</Text>
  <Text ID="254814">I hope you may still teach me of your ways.</Text>
  <Text ID="254815">Why should heaven not one day burst azure over us?</Text>
  <Text ID="254816">The causeway remains at high tide, though it cannot be seen. </Text>
  <Text ID="254786">I must trust my instinct.</Text>
  <Text ID="254817">Moons wax, then wane.</Text>
  <Text ID="254818">Thoughts of home draw me away.</Text>
  <Text ID="254819">Our traditions remain very different.</Text>
  <Text ID="254820">You have a strange fragrance.</Text>
  <Text ID="254821">Acid winds blow in the passes.</Text>
  <Text ID="254822">Paint slowly weeps from the face of trust.</Text>
  <Text ID="254823">Sunlight is broken by ravens.</Text>
  <Text ID="265526">I too am a close friend</Text>
  <Text ID="265527">Birds of a feather…</Text>
  <Text ID="265529">My parents put their faith in the wrong place too… </Text>
  <Text ID="265530">You know a person by the friends they choose. </Text>
  <Text ID="265532">I suppose you cannot see their admirable qualities… </Text>
  <Text ID="265533">Among friends, it is better to remain cordial.</Text>
  <Text ID="265535">Weeds should not be watered.</Text>
  <Text ID="265536">Why tend a dead tree. </Text>
  <Text ID="265528">A serpent under my friend's pillow… </Text>
  <Text ID="265534">You shame yourself at the house of my friend.</Text>
  <Text ID="265531">The Empress admires your subtlety. </Text>
  <Text ID="265537">The Empress is impressed by your methods. </Text>
  <Text ID="256514">I wish for my people to blossom like your summer garden.</Text>
  <Text ID="256527">The imperial court will hear of your impressive kingdom.</Text>
  <Text ID="256528">Perhaps I was wrong to think rushing ahead tactless...</Text>
  <Text ID="256534">I write of your extraordinary expansion in my biji.</Text>
  <Text ID="256535">How will so much land be governed?</Text>
  <Text ID="256536">Your settlements grow like bamboo!</Text>
  <Text ID="257043">Like the gentle artist you stretch out your canvas.</Text>
  <Text ID="257044">You must show me how a business expands so fast!</Text>
  <Text ID="258235">Both Empress and Emperor are set on investment.</Text>
  <Text ID="258236">So expensive?! How will I afford the rest?</Text>
  <Text ID="258237">I fear my family did not foresee such costs.</Text>
  <Text ID="258238">It is beyond my control what happens to your island now.</Text>
  <Text ID="258239">I fear the Empress will demand I take over your island…  </Text>
  <Text ID="258240">Your kind interest is perhaps not as helpful as you may think. </Text>
  <Text ID="258241">You have a share… I must be happy for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258242">They will be most disappointed I have lost ground.</Text>
  <Text ID="258243">I beg you to consider what disgrace would fall upon me. </Text>
  <Text ID="258244">Do not wield the dagger of ambition.</Text>
  <Text ID="258249">This island is the earthly twin of Tian, the mighty heaven!</Text>

  <Text ID="258251">The kingdom is divided.</Text>
  <Text ID="258246">The stones may be gone, but ghosts will haunt you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258247">You have little respect for your antecedents.</Text>
  <Text ID="258248">Legacy goes beyond what is physical.</Text>
  <Text ID="261128">Perhaps this island is as yet unclaimed?</Text>
  <Text ID="261129">Does this land belong to your Queen, or may I...?</Text>
  <Text ID="261130">I wish to found a new kingdom here.</Text>

  <Text ID="251320">Look at that majestic building, whatever it is!</Text>
  <Text ID="251321">I built that with my own hands, in a way.</Text>
  <Text ID="251322">Never knew that was there until now!</Text>
  <Text ID="251323">Ooh is that mine too?</Text>
  <Text ID="251324">I was wondering where that naughty ship'd got to!</Text>
  <Text ID="251325">Hang on a minute, isn't that one of mine?</Text>
  <Text ID="251326">The sea breeze. Can't you feel the shrimps?</Text>
  <Text ID="251327">They say it's bad luck if I'm aboard, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.</Text>

  <Text ID="251348">I know what hard work is. Never had to do it meself...but I've an idea of it, like. </Text>
  <Text ID="251349">Wibble Soc is a society of trickery and legerdemain. I am its principal, everywhere and nowhere at once!</Text>
  <Text ID="251350">The apparition! Always there in me mind's dreams. It whispers gravely, 'give me back that money you nit.' </Text>
  <Text ID="251351">I see it now. I am a vessel of 'occult forces', imbued with the untold power of gold.</Text>
  <Text ID="251353">No shame in a name like Wibblesock. It's actually pronounced 'Wibblaysoak' though, so remember that.</Text>
  <Text ID="251361">Lovely Lady Hunt reminds me of my old mum, looking down, thinking, how did he do so well?</Text>
  <Text ID="251362">Oooh that Malching! I've had him an' his furry door-knocker in my dreams, telling me what I ain't.</Text>
  <Text ID="251363">Bente I adore thee, like a rose what smells lovely. One day I'll o'erstride, the darn class divide, and we'll uncork a bottle o' bubbly. </Text>
  <Text ID="251364">Don't make me say Alonso's name, please! He puts the willies up old Willie.</Text>
  <Text ID="251365">Vicente Silva's a bit of an 'awkins, eh? Never takes time to say hello.</Text>
  <Text ID="251366">I'm not sure old George can hear a word anyone says. Nothing I say, anyway!</Text>
  <Text ID="251367">She can be mean Beryl. Reminds me a bit of mum though, which is nice.</Text>
  <Text ID="251368">Artur's like a hall o' mirrors. I feel lost around him.</Text>

  <Text ID="251609">I know you are, but what am I?</Text>
  <Text ID="251610">Actually I gave it a scrubbing yesterday, so shut it!</Text>
  <Text ID="251611">Deary-me, doesn't even rhyme.</Text>
  <Text ID="251612">Take a look in the looking-glass!</Text>
  <Text ID="251613">Eugh, no! Only my handkerchiefs are made o' silk.</Text>
  <Text ID="251614">Pigeon pervert!</Text>
  <Text ID="251615">Please! You've never even seen my wand.</Text>
  <Text ID="251616">I ain't telling you how my tricks are done, if that's your game.</Text>
  <Text ID="251618">How...how dare you! My tricks never go wrong!</Text>
  <Text ID="251619">No-one's allowed to call me that anymore!</Text>
  <Text ID="251620">You can't make me cry, you...you...twig crevice!</Text>
  <Text ID="251621">Why does everyone always gang-up on me?</Text>
  <Text ID="251622">You're right! The board should put more faith in me!</Text>
  <Text ID="251623">Thanks! Here's another - take this simple card, and I'll tell you right away what it is(!)</Text>
  <Text ID="251624">Oh course! Many, many, many beautiful assistants...</Text>
  <Text ID="251625">Yeah! I suppose I am, and mum was the toughest - I should know!</Text>
  <Text ID="254785">So it weren't you in white last night at the chime o' twelve?! </Text>
  <Text ID="254826">We're mates, remember?</Text>
  <Text ID="254827">Think of all the good times we've had.</Text>
  <Text ID="254828">I have a duty of care vis-a-vis vous you know?</Text>
  <Text ID="254829">You're my best pupil..and the only one.</Text>
  <Text ID="254830">I see a young me in you; I used to be so naïve.</Text>
  <Text ID="254831">Me and you. Sounds great, doesn't it?</Text>
  <Text ID="254832">You never seem as cruel as the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="254787">I've had visions of you in my mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="254833">You could still be pretty scary if you wanted.</Text>
  <Text ID="254834">I dreamt about you last night.</Text>
  <Text ID="254835">The magic is wearing off.</Text>
  <Text ID="254836">It's all an illusion, everything. </Text>
  <Text ID="254837">To be honest, I've had better assistants.</Text>
  <Text ID="254838">My crystal ball calls you a purveyor of the dark arts.</Text>
  <Text ID="254839">Those beyond the grave speak ill of you.</Text>
  <Text ID="265538">And it was Willie what brought you two together!</Text>
  <Text ID="265539">I've never had a group of friends before!</Text>
  <Text ID="265541">What plot are you hatching?</Text>
  <Text ID="265542">You don't plan on coming for me, or…?</Text>
  <Text ID="265544">Leave my friend alone!</Text>
  <Text ID="265545">So I'm not the only one you bully.</Text>
  <Text ID="265547">I wish I could stand up to them like that.</Text>
  <Text ID="265548">Teach 'em a lesson!</Text>
  <Text ID="265540">You're spooking me mates…</Text>
  <Text ID="265546">Stop creeping up on everybody!</Text>
  <Text ID="265543">Time someone who deserves it was haunted!</Text>
  <Text ID="265549">My little apprentice, now a master of shadows!</Text>
  <Text ID="256540">All depends which people you get, you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="256541">Leapt ahead!? What's your trick?</Text>
  <Text ID="256542">You can't just leave old Wibbly behind!</Text>
  <Text ID="256545">If you're going to improve again, you'll need to watch and learn!</Text>
  <Text ID="256546">Corr, a bit slow ain't yer!</Text>
  <Text ID="256547">Got to watch out for whippersnappers like you at my heels!</Text>
  <Text ID="256550">Settle down! Where d'you get that island?</Text>
  <Text ID="256551">Before you 'exparnd' again, remember what we said, alright?</Text>
  <Text ID="256552">You just crossed paths with the great Wibbly!</Text>
  <Text ID="257045">Typical of you to rub it in, when my board won't let me expand.</Text>
  <Text ID="257046">It's indecent, your luck with islands.</Text>
  <Text ID="256537">Nothing compared to the miracle of old Willie's expansions!</Text>
  <Text ID="256538">Course, I see a lot of new islands, but you must be really proud.</Text>
  <Text ID="256539">Want more acquisition advice? Door's always open. </Text>
  <Text ID="257047">I still have more islands than you, if you need a friend.</Text>
  <Text ID="257048">You still have much to learn about expansion, young one!</Text>
  <Text ID="251654">My money's on you, so don't pull up lame!</Text>
  <Text ID="251657">Don't let me down, eh, I've backed you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251658">Share the wealth, that's what they say isn't it!</Text>
  <Text ID="251659">Who's dancing on whose face now?</Text>
  <Text ID="251660">Um, you know that island that was yours... </Text>
  <Text ID="251661">Stocks and shares, eh?! Cor!</Text>
  <Text ID="251662">Maybe you can help me charm the other shareholders!</Text>
  <Text ID="251663">Lots of people buy into my island now, I'm popular!</Text>
  <Text ID="251665">No one ever put that much trust in me… </Text>
  <Text ID="251666">You could take over? So, like a vassal, or? </Text>
  <Text ID="251670">I don't need the board telling me whose islands to settle!</Text>
  <Text ID="251671">You are generous with yer islands, don't mind if do!</Text>
  <Text ID="251674">Chip off the old block, eh? Little tearaway.</Text>
  <Text ID="251677">A prestigious acr'age which comes to you in the finest shape. </Text>
  <Text ID="251676">You've got no class, wiping the chalkboard like that.</Text>
  <Text ID="251682">That was my shrine to mother!</Text>
  <Text ID="251683">All my brilliant work has been needlessly wasted!</Text>
  <Text ID="261131">Could this be my lucky island!?</Text>
  <Text ID="261132">If you don't want it, you should share it.</Text>
  <Text ID="261133">This one doesn't look too scary, d'you mind?</Text>
  <Text ID="251684">Do I have to?</Text>
  <Text ID="251704">I'll saw you in two!</Text>
  <Text ID="251705">Begone baneful ghost! (still afraid)</Text>
  <Text ID="256060">Believe me, I know what hurts.</Text>
  <Text ID="256061">Who's the bully now!</Text>
  <Text ID="251685">Wibblyist!</Text>
  <Text ID="251707">I'll prestidigitate you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251708">Mum! MUM!</Text>
  <Text ID="267988">Remember the dress rehersal! </Text>
  <Text ID="267989">You big bully!</Text>
  <Text ID="251687">Now you know how it feels!</Text>
  <Text ID="251710">Mama, I just killed some men…</Text>
  <Text ID="251711">Alakazam, its vanished!</Text>
  <Text ID="251690">More spectres to haunt me…</Text>
  <Text ID="251712">For all my magiks, I cannot bring back the dead!</Text>
  <Text ID="251713">Port! Starb'd! Aw, too late!</Text>
  <Text ID="251691">Shazam!</Text>
  <Text ID="251714">Can't believe you let me do this to your city.</Text>
  <Text ID="251715">That's for all those people who mocked me!</Text>
  <Text ID="251692">Oh mum, my powers are failing me!</Text>
  <Text ID="251716">The aegis collapses!</Text>
  <Text ID="251693">Must be humiliating, seeing me take this from you! </Text>
  <Text ID="251717">It's not how it looks, alright? Shareholders made me take it.</Text>
  <Text ID="251718">They took me harbour mum!</Text>
  <Text ID="251720">Take it all, just don't hurt little Wibbly!</Text>
  <Text ID="251694">Tell me you're still breathing? Mum, what have I done to my protege? Is this a dagger I see before me? </Text>
  <Text ID="251695">I been found out mum. The ghost, the money came back to haunt me in the end. S'pose we can talk about it now, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="251696">Not me friend! I don't have many you know!</Text>
  <Text ID="251721">If you're going after my friends, I'm probably next!</Text>
  <Text ID="251697">I'm glad our enemy is all-a-cock, but take it easy alright? </Text>
  <Text ID="251722">And you ain't afraid they'll come back to haunt you?</Text>
  <Text ID="251698">And I thought I was the gallant knight!</Text>
  <Text ID="251723">I know a fair bit about punches myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="251724">Mum said the best form of attack is defence.</Text>
  <Text ID="251725">That's the spirit, put a bit of wibbly up 'em.</Text>
  <Text ID="251699">Wind me up, and I'll strike like a cuckoo clock!</Text>
  <Text ID="251726">Who you sharpening that stick for?</Text>
  <Text ID="251727">Rule one of the Wibble Soc. code, don't hurt me.</Text>
  <Text ID="251728">Doesn't matter who started it, cut it out! </Text>
  <Text ID="251700">Quick, now's when I need you! I can't hide forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="251729">You have to help me, I started a war!</Text>
  <Text ID="261206">I'm in a war with your mate, but I think I know where your loyalties lie.</Text>
  <Text ID="251701">Damsel in distress fear not, your hero approaches astride his steed! </Text>
  <Text ID="251731">You need my help...course...not  someone scary is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="251702">The board say I'm not allowed to talk to you, like.</Text>
  <Text ID="251733">Oh it's you...haha, aren't we sposed to be at war? Haha.</Text>
  <Text ID="251734">Sealed by magic, you won't get in, it's absolutely 'permeable'!</Text>
  <Text ID="251703">One of my versatile platypuses, waiting to pounce!</Text>
  <Text ID="251735">Prepared to run to the ends of the earth for me. </Text>
  <Text ID="251736">The embowelment of my fighting spirit!</Text>
  <Text ID="255968">Eugh! Get your dirty pox away from me!</Text>
  <Text ID="255969">Don't your people use a hanky?</Text>
  <Text ID="255972">The twisted demon faces in the flames!</Text>
  <Text ID="255973">Everlasting fire punishing us for our sins.</Text>
  <Text ID="256723">Don't see much evidence of your muscle...not that I need to.</Text>
  <Text ID="256724">Words can hurt, you big bully.</Text>
  <Text ID="256725">Think you can browbeat us with yer perfidious rag?</Text>
  <Text ID="264951">Going on an adventure? Don't be scared if old Wibbly can also do it.</Text>
  <Text ID="265496">The World's Fair? Will there be magicians?</Text>
  <Text ID="265760">Hey, leave Bente alone, alright?</Text>
  <Text ID="265764">If Beryl's anything like mum, you're dead meat!</Text>
  <Text ID="265770">Good, I hate those spooky, scary pirates!</Text>
  <Text ID="265771">Teach them pirates not to come for Willie at night!</Text>
  <Text ID="265772">Hey! I saw her first!</Text>
  <Text ID="265776">Ah Beryl! She always loves it when I make myself disappear!</Text>
  <Text ID="265782">You're in league with pirate Annie! Eurgh, stay away!</Text>
  <Text ID="265783">You do know Fortune is against the crown?</Text>
  <Text ID="267990">Mum always said be ambitious!</Text>
  <Text ID="267991">An eye for the extravaganza— wonder where you get that from! </Text>
  <Text ID="267992">Don't forget to bring yer old Willie a souvenir! </Text>
  <Text ID="267993">Treasures! They're not cursed, right…? </Text>
  <Text ID="267994">Wow have you got some big ones there!</Text>
  <Text ID="261148">Sorry your father's dead. I remember when I lost me old mum; always think of her when things are going wrong. </Text>
  <Text ID="261149">Like you I'd do anything for the Queen. Reminds me of me mum. Younger et cetera, but you know, intimidating.</Text>
  <Text ID="267921">Oh gawd, what have you got yourself into now?</Text>
  <Text ID="267922">The New World, blimey. Sounds a long way away!</Text>
  <Text ID="261150">I hear stories about those Pyrphorians that have me tossing and turning til daybreak.</Text>
  <Text ID="261151">Cor that Edvard eh? Deserves a really nasty end!</Text>
  <Text ID="266594">The Pyrphorians! Don't come for me, I'm really low class!</Text>
  <Text ID="266595">You must have fed off my resilient aura there, driving the P-p-pyrphorians away.</Text>
  <Text ID="261384">Going behind me back, that is so naughty, that is! </Text>
  <Text ID="261385">I found 'em, you're in big trouble, you is!</Text>
  <Text ID="261386">Et tu Brute? Stab your old mate Wibbly?</Text>
  <Text ID="261387">Don't you start haunting me with your phantoms!</Text>
  <Text ID="261388">So…you're part of the mafia as well?</Text>
  <Text ID="261389">I am master of shadows! What do you mean you found 'em?</Text>
  <Text ID="261390">I honestly have no idea who they were.</Text>
  <Text ID="261391">Honour bright, I'll never do it again.</Text>
  <Text ID="261392">Means we're both as cunning as each other then, eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="261393">Don't reach up my sleeves, that is the first rule!</Text>
  <Text ID="261394">Cor science and all that? You're a braver one than I.</Text>
  <Text ID="261395">Nice science! Bit complicated though, innit?</Text>
  <Text ID="261396">Ooh, researching new tricks?</Text>
  <Text ID="261397">An apple fell on my head too, and it bloody hurt!</Text>
  <Text ID="261398">Science cheapens magic! </Text>
  <Text ID="261399">A magician NEVER reveals his secrets.</Text>
  <Text ID="253273">If you don't make a change, most often, no-one will…</Text>
  <Text ID="253274">Show me how strong your values are.</Text>
  <Text ID="253275">Let's see if you're as principled as you claim…</Text>
  <Text ID="253276">Never let me hear you say life lacks challenge…</Text>
  <Text ID="253277">Everyone should work for their corn…</Text>
  <Text ID="253278">Go out there, make your case.</Text>
  <Text ID="253279">Seems we hold the same perspective.</Text>
  <Text ID="253280">Fight for it if you have to.</Text>
  <Text ID="253281">Respect where it is due.</Text>
  <Text ID="253282">That took no small amount of courage.</Text>
  <Text ID="253283">Such kindness humbles me.</Text>
  <Text ID="253284">I appreciate that, really I do.</Text>
  <Text ID="253285">Your hard work has paid off, as hard work always does.</Text>
  <Text ID="253286">Most folk take every chance they get!</Text>
  <Text ID="253287">What are you resisting!?</Text>
  <Text ID="253288">Oh, so you don't like work?</Text>
  <Text ID="253289">You've let no-one down but yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="253290">You wouldn’t have survived a day in those mines.</Text>
  <Text ID="253291">Get off your lazy hide and set to it!</Text>
  <Text ID="253292">You can't plough a field by turning it over in your mind!</Text>
  <Text ID="253293">Complacency is the father of ignorance.</Text>
  <Text ID="253294">Peace flowers want water more days than one.</Text>
  <Text ID="253295">When we stop working, we stop living…</Text>
  <Text ID="253296">Bad news is, that's not the hardest part…</Text>
  <Text ID="253297">In it for yourself, or for all of us?!</Text>
  <Text ID="253298">The only choice is the right choice!</Text>
  <Text ID="255413">You've got something for me, haven't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255414">Brought this tiresome business to a close?</Text>
  <Text ID="255415">Don't just sit there, hand it in!</Text>
  <Text ID="257155">Yes, you're hard working, but impatient!</Text>
  <Text ID="257156">Give me some time can't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="257157">Didn't I tell you, I don't have anything!</Text>
  <Text ID="257158">Didn't you say you'd provide me an escort?</Text>
  <Text ID="257159">Help an old man across the sea won't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="257160">I take a few good people wherever I go.</Text>
  <Text ID="261152">Don't let them judge you by your father's actions; you're your own person.</Text>
  <Text ID="267877">Even if your father was a traitor, I won't judge you before I know you.</Text>
  <Text ID="261153">I hear you're building warships—arms dealer to the Empire…</Text>
  <Text ID="267911">I don't like what goes on in that prison any more than you do.</Text>
  <Text ID="267912">A little bird tells me you're meeting Isabel? There's a woman who understands progress.</Text>

  <Text ID="266577">Bring an end to this age of terror!</Text>
  <Text ID="266578">Two flawed men. But there was good in them, as there is in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="253299">Where's my ear trumpet? Want me to do what? You must be out of your mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="253300">I know what it's like to have to choose. Whatever you decide, stick by it.</Text>
  <Text ID="253301">Just let me be, I'm fine! All I need is my goddamn walking cane!</Text>
  <Text ID="253302">You know, I almost smiled. </Text>
  <Text ID="253303">I wish a few others could have seen this. </Text>
  <Text ID="253304">Makes me want to believe again. </Text>
  <Text ID="253305">Life doesn't seem so wretched now. </Text>
  <Text ID="253306">Sun's out from behind the cloud. </Text>
  <Text ID="253307">Seems I'm one of the lucky ones.</Text>
  <Text ID="253308">I'm hopeful yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="253309">I've met so many worse than you. </Text>
  <Text ID="253310">I see you have a heart.  </Text>
  <Text ID="253311">What you've done takes guts. </Text>
  <Text ID="253312">Good, keep believing. </Text>
  <Text ID="253313">You incline to what is right. </Text>
  <Text ID="253314">You have a conscience. </Text>
  <Text ID="253315">I admire your conduct. </Text>
  <Text ID="253316">Then the bad old days are back.</Text>
  <Text ID="253317">Even now, the same damn bunk!</Text>
  <Text ID="253318">God-damn!</Text>
  <Text ID="253319">Hell's bells!</Text>
  <Text ID="253320">Did I hear that nonsense right?!</Text>
  <Text ID="253321">Injustice! </Text>
  <Text ID="253322">The indignity! </Text>
  <Text ID="253323">Oh I don't hate you, I just don't like you. </Text>
  <Text ID="253324">I don't stoop to hate, but you run me close. </Text>
  <Text ID="253325">You appal me.</Text>
  <Text ID="253326">Better than some is still worse than most.</Text>
  <Text ID="253327">I find your whole standpoint supremely questionable. </Text>
  <Text ID="253328">Your moral compass goes south fast. </Text>
  <Text ID="253329">You're blind as a mole, and just as dirty.</Text>
  <Text ID="253330">I'm not the type to think all people bad, so let's just wait and see how you go.</Text>
  <Text ID="253331">You can't get on the wrong side of me, not if you're on the right side.</Text>

  <Text ID="253335">Come to rattle your mouth over your great deeds?</Text>
  <Text ID="253336">Come to lord it over an old man?</Text>

  <Text ID="253349">May I express my gratitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="253350">Oh, fine. </Text>
  <Text ID="253351">Amen to that.</Text>
  <Text ID="253352">Preaching to the converted!</Text>
  <Text ID="253353">I don't subscribe to that credo.</Text>

  <Text ID="258261">Beryl always gets her answer, see! </Text>
  <Text ID="258262">You've a knack for this, haven't yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="258263">Yer as good as gold. </Text>
  <Text ID="258264">You're a cunning one! </Text>
  <Text ID="258265">Well played indeed, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="258266">Yer a peculiar sort o' genius. </Text>
  <Text ID="258267">You'll soon be making a name for yourself! </Text>
  <Text ID="258268">You're already an example to me little helpers! </Text>
  <Text ID="258269">It is a terrible shame, it is.</Text>
  <Text ID="258270">I expect the vultures will be circling… </Text>
  <Text ID="258271">Ah! This won't do at all. </Text>
  <Text ID="258272">Something will have to be done! </Text>
  <Text ID="258273">Seems I'll be fetching me birch rod again.</Text>
  <Text ID="258274">Might be time for Beryl to turn beastly! </Text>
  <Text ID="258275">I don't like what I'm seeing. </Text>
  <Text ID="258276">Regrettable, don't you think? </Text>
  <Text ID="258277">My ragamuffins all have their wee eyes on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258278">We don't all worship the ground yer walk on. </Text>
  <Text ID="258279">Don't think I don't know.</Text>
  <Text ID="258280">Misbehaving, aren't we? </Text>
  <Text ID="258281">You've landed yerself in a spot o' bother, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="258282">You've gone and planted yerself feet first in concrete. </Text>
  <Text ID="256489">Beryl O'Mara. I run things around here, in me own little way, like.</Text>
  <Text ID="256490">So lovely to meet you, dearie! But a word of advice: always watch your back.</Text>
  <Text ID="256844">A smile AND a gun would get you farther.</Text>
  <Text ID="256845">Let's share a cup, dearie!</Text>
  <Text ID="256846">Spot o' poker?</Text>
  <Text ID="256847">Fine to see you, my sweet!</Text>
  <Text ID="256848">Ah, speak of the devil!</Text>
  <Text ID="256849">Stirred up trouble lately, by any chance?</Text>
  <Text ID="256850">Good to see you still got yer kneecaps!</Text>
  <Text ID="260869">Looking for my little regulars? Ah you won't spot 'em so easy.</Text>
  <Text ID="260870">Give 'em work and education, and they'll forgive yer all else.</Text>
  <Text ID="260871">I pride meself on what I've built for the urchins. </Text>
  <Text ID="260872">People should love yer, and if they don't, should fear yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="260873">What's down in the hold is my concern not yours, dear.</Text>
  <Text ID="260874">She may look sweet, but she'll hit below the belt if she has to.</Text>
  <Text ID="260875">If you want to get ahead, keep on the move.</Text>
  <Text ID="260876">They know not to be followed, they do.</Text>
  <Text ID="258283">What a sweet gesture!</Text>
  <Text ID="258284">Looks like I owe this time.</Text>
  <Text ID="258285">I don't forget a favour.</Text>
  <Text ID="258286">Sounds grand!</Text>
  <Text ID="258287">It's a promise.</Text>
  <Text ID="258288">All in good hands now.</Text>
  <Text ID="260877">We all have our little superstitions. I like to keep a knife in me satin boots.</Text>
  <Text ID="260878">Careful who you call friends. I'd rather have a bar of gold than a hundred of silver.</Text>
  <Text ID="260879">Keep your cards close to your chest, dearie. Check every dice thrice.</Text>
  <Text ID="260880">They call me a saint! Bless their little hearts, they don't know I'm a sinner!</Text>
  <Text ID="260881">I'll let you in on a secret, I'll always try to be nice. Life's too short.</Text>
  <Text ID="260882">I think we all know Willie's a numbskull. That's why we love him.</Text>
  <Text ID="260883">Bente is lovely; she knows absolutely nothing about the world, and the way things are.</Text>
  <Text ID="260884">Princess Qing enjoys forgeries like they're masterworks, and y'know, I agree with her.</Text>
  <Text ID="260885">God knows I'm not perfect, but Alonso might consider going to confession once in a while. </Text>
  <Text ID="260886">I reckon George Smith could've made a lot of money if he weren't such a stickler.</Text>
  <Text ID="260887">Last time Gasparov gave me a lecture, I pocketed a drawer of his silverware.</Text>
  <Text ID="260888">Carl is a disgusting, downright shameful creature, and I can't stop thinking about him.</Text>
  <Text ID="260889">You'd have to be pretty gullible to believe Lady Margaret's what she seems.</Text>
  <Text ID="260890">I've played chess with Silva; when he saw he was losing, he tried to upset the board.</Text>
  <Text ID="255339">Money makes the world turn.</Text>
  <Text ID="255340">Gotta get what you can, while you can.</Text>
  <Text ID="255341"> A cute bit o' business for yers.</Text>
  <Text ID="255342">Are you sure that's the price? Just checkin', dear.</Text>
  <Text ID="255343">A fair exchange, wouldn't you say?</Text>
  <Text ID="255344">So long as you got somethin', we'll be fine friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="255345">A few tricks o' the trade.</Text>
  <Text ID="256935">You ain't the flaky business partner I took you to be!</Text>
  <Text ID="256936">When it comes to trade, you never disappoint.</Text>
  <Text ID="256937">I'll be blowed, always keeping up your end of the bargain!</Text>
  <Text ID="258295">Why would I do a thing like that?</Text>
  <Text ID="258296">Stone the crows, no!</Text>
  <Text ID="258297">I'd prefer not to speak of it again.</Text>
  <Text ID="254857">Play the game, shall we?</Text>
  <Text ID="254858">I got your best interests at heart, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="254859">Trust me on this one.</Text>
  <Text ID="254860">I'm offering you a way to get ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="254861">I know what's good for you, my sweet.</Text>
  <Text ID="254862">Don't think I don't know your vices.</Text>
  <Text ID="254863">I know your weakness, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="254864">Forgive me dusting off my revolver.</Text>
  <Text ID="254865">Here's that offer you can't refuse.</Text>
  <Text ID="254866">Don't want to go belly-up, do yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="254867">Put that in your pipe and smoke it.</Text>
  <Text ID="254868">Be sure to hold up your end of it. </Text>
  <Text ID="254870">I'll bite, this once.</Text>
  <Text ID="254869">Long as you know what you're getting into.</Text>
  <Text ID="254871">I'd be a fool not to.</Text>
  <Text ID="254872">Say no more.</Text>
  <Text ID="254873">A lobster trap.</Text>
  <Text ID="254874">Pull the wool over my eyes? Never.</Text>
  <Text ID="254875">Oh dearie, you'll have to try harder.</Text>
  <Text ID="254876">I know a rip-off when I see one.</Text>
  <Text ID="254877">The richer the dealmaker, the poorer the deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="256139">There'll be no winning with you, will there?</Text>
  <Text ID="256183">I can't get blood from a stone.</Text>
  <Text ID="256184">You've pushed ol' Beryl too far.</Text>
  <Text ID="256185">That's quite enough o' that, now.</Text>
  <Text ID="256186">There'll be no new deal today.</Text>
  <Text ID="254878">I dare say we can do better than that.</Text>
  <Text ID="254881">Time to lay my cards on the table.</Text>
  <Text ID="254882">I'll raise you.</Text>
  <Text ID="254879">Sometimes you cut your losses.</Text>
  <Text ID="254883">Ol' Beryl knows when to fold.</Text>
  <Text ID="254884">You won the match, but this game's never over!</Text>
  <Text ID="254880">Yer barking up the wrong tree.</Text>
  <Text ID="254885">I've been in business far too long to fall for that.</Text>
  <Text ID="254886">Do yer worst!</Text>
  <Text ID="254887">You owe me, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="254889">You know how favours work?</Text>
  <Text ID="254890">Let Auntie Beryl help yous out.</Text>
  <Text ID="254891">Keep friends close, I say.</Text>
  <Text ID="254892">Now, whadda you say?</Text>
  <Text ID="254888">It's just business, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="254893">You'll come 'round eventually.</Text>
  <Text ID="254894">You'd do the same if you was me.</Text>
  <Text ID="254895">Don't take it to heart, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="254896">It's nothing personal, now.</Text>
  <Text ID="257912">I'd hate to be in your slippers right now.</Text>
  <Text ID="257914">Needless to say, there'll be no hiding from me!</Text>
  <Text ID="257915">Don't fret, I'll make sure they never find your body.</Text>
  <Text ID="257913">Just a disagreement between friends, is all.</Text>
  <Text ID="257916">Was it really worth falling out over?</Text>
  <Text ID="258316">Will you give me time to do my laundry?</Text>
  <Text ID="258347">Tea break?</Text>
  <Text ID="258348">I think we better reload our muskets? </Text>
  <Text ID="258349">We'd make a mint on trading, we would.</Text>
  <Text ID="258350">You can come to Beryl any time, day or night. </Text>
  <Text ID="258351">Don't say you don't trust old Beryl! </Text>
  <Text ID="258352">Sorry, my sweet, but it's just not paying off.</Text>
  <Text ID="258353">Times change, we all change!</Text>
  <Text ID="258354">Trade is about getting more out than you put in. </Text>
  <Text ID="258355">People won't cross yer, if yer friends with old Beryl.</Text>
  <Text ID="258356">It's smarter to stick together at first.</Text>
  <Text ID="258357">The wind is quick to turn, is it not. </Text>
  <Text ID="258358">But you were becoming a liability dear.</Text>
  <Text ID="258359">No strings! </Text>
  <Text ID="258360">You will remember your benefactor, I hope. </Text>
  <Text ID="258361">Don't spend it all at once!</Text>
  <Text ID="254897">Ain't that sweet of yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="254899">Trying to get in me good books, now?</Text>
  <Text ID="254900">Want to go places, do yer?</Text>
  <Text ID="254901">Hoping to butter my teacakes, is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="254902">Yer after something, now.</Text>
  <Text ID="254898">Ha! I heard you was schemin'.</Text>
  <Text ID="254903">Oh sure, you can try and step on my toes.</Text>
  <Text ID="254904">What's this little rebellion of yours?</Text>
  <Text ID="254905">I don't upset, dearie. </Text>
  <Text ID="254906">And we were getting along s'well.</Text>
  <Text ID="257917">Right! I'll go get my big ol' shotgun. </Text>
  <Text ID="257919">I will warn yer, the last one's swimmin' with the fishes. </Text>
  <Text ID="257920">If it's war you want, then war it shall be.</Text>
  <Text ID="257918">Oh yes, it's all in the past now.</Text>
  <Text ID="257921">I'm all for wiping the slate clean.</Text>
  <Text ID="258362">I'd wager we could both use a breather.</Text>
  <Text ID="258363">Lovely, I'll boil a pot o' tea.</Text>
  <Text ID="258364">There's room aplenty under my wing.</Text>
  <Text ID="258365">I've high-quality for oddly cheap prices.</Text>
  <Text ID="258366">I know exactly where to get what you need.</Text>
  <Text ID="258367">Whenever you back out, you can expect retribution. </Text>
  <Text ID="258368">You're the sort to deny people their dreams, are you? </Text>
  <Text ID="258369">No one teach you to keep yer friends close?</Text>
  <Text ID="258370">And take down the big fish you mean? Count me in.</Text>
  <Text ID="258371">Oh sure, I can watch your back too.</Text>
  <Text ID="258372">You never do know who'll turn on the other first. </Text>
  <Text ID="258373">Ah, you beat me to the punch!</Text>
  <Text ID="257922">Let's keep that one on the quiet.</Text>
  <Text ID="257923">Maybe I'll give part to me street urchins. A small part.</Text>
  <Text ID="257924">Was that an attempt an an insult, dearie?</Text>
  <Text ID="257928">You can't shock me, my sweet.</Text>
  <Text ID="257929">Oh I've heard much worse out o' me little ragamuffins.</Text>
  <Text ID="257930">Oh I knows I'm a crook - let's see how long it takes the rest to notice.</Text>
  <Text ID="257925">Agh, don't go wasting yer gift fer the gab on me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257931">Oh away with yer! What a lotta hot gas!</Text>
  <Text ID="257932">Flattery can be a great tool, when yer use it on the right people.</Text>
  <Text ID="257933">Trying to wrap me 'round your pinkie? I don't think so.</Text>
  <Text ID="257926">Which finger was it, you were least attached to?</Text>
  <Text ID="257934">At least yer honest.</Text>
  <Text ID="257935">You don't like me? Never said you had to.</Text>
  <Text ID="257936">Just when I wasn't sure if I had the heart to hurt yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="257927">Sticky words, but a little sweetness once in a while can't hurt.</Text>
  <Text ID="257937">Yer almost make ol' Beryl feel part o' society.</Text>
  <Text ID="257938">So nice to hear nice words, even if that's all they are.</Text>
  <Text ID="257939">Kind of you to say, no matter what yer really think of ol' Beryl.</Text>
  <Text ID="254907">We always got along, ain't that right?</Text>
  <Text ID="254908">My urchins say lovely things about you, they do.</Text>
  <Text ID="254909">Always felt like taking yer under my wing.</Text>
  <Text ID="254911">If you was out there in the cold, I'd adopt yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="254910">Whenever I think on yer, I get dreadful soft feelings.</Text>
  <Text ID="254912">Auntie Beryl'lls always there when yer need her.</Text>
  <Text ID="254913">You and I aren't like the others, we know it's all a game.</Text>
  <Text ID="254914">I don't like what they say about yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="254915">You've no face fer poker.</Text>
  <Text ID="254916">I'm not sure you'll be one to get yer mitts dirty.</Text>
  <Text ID="254917">We ought to share tea more often. </Text>
  <Text ID="254918">There's a rat in yer laundry.</Text>
  <Text ID="254919">I don't alwayshear what I want to hear about yer.</Text>
  <Text ID="254920">Far be it from me to bank on gossip.</Text>
  <Text ID="254921">You've always been a sharp one. </Text>
  <Text ID="254922">I've to trust my instincts where you're concerned.</Text>
  <Text ID="265562">You two are so sweet together.</Text>
  <Text ID="265563">Maybe you could both come for tea and one biscuit.</Text>
  <Text ID="265565">That's a funny choice for a friend!</Text>
  <Text ID="265566">Some friends are trouble.</Text>
  <Text ID="265568">I don't like to see my friends hurt.</Text>
  <Text ID="265569">A bad temper won't help anyone, you least of all.</Text>
  <Text ID="265571">That should sour their milk.</Text>
  <Text ID="265572">No-one likes them anyway! </Text>
  <Text ID="265564">You can slip under me friend's nose, but not mine. </Text>
  <Text ID="265570">You don't want to be playing this game with friends of Beryl… </Text>
  <Text ID="265567">It's my enemy, and I'm not one to judge!</Text>
  <Text ID="265573">Yer can skulk up their drainpipe all you like. </Text>
  <Text ID="256569">You'll trip, and I'll be past yer like the ol' tortoise.</Text>
  <Text ID="256570">Life'll soon take yer down a peg or two.</Text>
  <Text ID="256571">Can all go up in a moment, you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="256574">Enjoy a little of the limelight while it lasts.</Text>
  <Text ID="256575">Let's toast you climbing the ladder!</Text>
  <Text ID="256576">Just goes to show, hard work can make you a big fish.</Text>
  <Text ID="256579">Hold yer horses, or you may find their heads in yer bed.</Text>
  <Text ID="256580">I wouldn't ha' touched that patch with a bargepole.</Text>
  <Text ID="256581">D'ya even know what's under yer nose? </Text>
  <Text ID="257053">The bigger y'are the harder you'll fall.</Text>
  <Text ID="257054">I knew a fella that grew and grew, all it took was a pin to burst him.</Text>
  <Text ID="256582">I grew an empire from nothing too.</Text>
  <Text ID="256583">Quite the scale of operation, dear.</Text>
  <Text ID="256584">Better not to keep all the eggs in one basket.</Text>
  <Text ID="257055">We all need a plan B.</Text>
  <Text ID="257056">Little gains here and there can go a long way.</Text>
  <Text ID="260198">The trick is to invest in the right people.</Text>
  <Text ID="260199">Let old Beryl take a slice.</Text>
  <Text ID="260200">I like to have a finger in every pie.</Text>
  <Text ID="260201">Well I haven't snatched it just yet!</Text>
  <Text ID="260202">Islands, fame, a bit of money can buy anything.</Text>
  <Text ID="260203">Are you sure you want to part of my mob? </Text>
  <Text ID="260204">I know what you're after, and I can't let you have it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260205">Ah, so you want to play that game.</Text>
  <Text ID="260206">My island. Don't get any funny ideas. </Text>
  <Text ID="260207">Take it! I'll still be there in one way or other!</Text>
  <Text ID="260208">Beryl wouldn't want to take it behind yer back, now.</Text>
  <Text ID="260209">Nice to make a legitimate acquisition.</Text>
  <Text ID="260210">You can pull the strings there now.</Text>
  <Text ID="260211">As far as you know it's all yours.</Text>
  <Text ID="260212">Who cares about the past, I like to think in the present.</Text>
  <Text ID="260213">Everything changes, it's yer one guarantee in life. </Text>
  <Text ID="260214">I'd have made a clean break too.</Text>
  <Text ID="255839">Time to teach yer a lesson.</Text>
  <Text ID="255858">I've got a big stick in my hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="255859">Don't take it personally, dearie.</Text>
  <Text ID="255860">Good game to win!</Text>
  <Text ID="255861">Think I was joking around, now?</Text>
  <Text ID="255840">Beryl always shoots back!</Text>
  <Text ID="255862">You've got guts.</Text>
  <Text ID="255863">I'll dust off me shotgun.</Text>
  <Text ID="255864">All part of the game.</Text>
  <Text ID="255865">You'll regret it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255841">Life is loss and disappointment.</Text>
  <Text ID="255866">Will you'll learn now, not to cross me?</Text>
  <Text ID="255867">I had to made an example of you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255842">Don't think you've won already.</Text>
  <Text ID="255868">So you do have a ruthless streak!</Text>
  <Text ID="255869">I'll just have to build some more!</Text>
  <Text ID="255843">Always expect a bit o' collateral.</Text>
  <Text ID="255870">See where I'm coming from now?</Text>
  <Text ID="255844">It's alright, I'm insured.</Text>
  <Text ID="255871">I don't go in for criminal damage myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="255845">Game, set and match! Thank you very much.</Text>
  <Text ID="255872">There, there, you'll be right again soon enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="255846">If you give it, you gotta take it. Fair play to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255873">How about a rematch?</Text>
  <Text ID="255848">When we play, we need to be prepared to lose. All of it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255849">Better to bow out all yer big guns blazin' into the night, than die o' gout in a debtor's gaol. </Text>
  <Text ID="255850">It is a shame, but also less competition.</Text>
  <Text ID="255875">I suppose getting too attached is bad for business.</Text>
  <Text ID="255851">Good riddance. One nuisance less!</Text>
  <Text ID="255876">Oh, it's so nice and quiet all of a sudden!</Text>
  <Text ID="255852">Make sure you back up yer words, now.</Text>
  <Text ID="255877">Gotta keep a knife in yer knickers. </Text>
  <Text ID="255878">Beryl never takes any nonsense neither.</Text>
  <Text ID="255879">Gotta chance yer arm</Text>
  <Text ID="255853">Who yer kiddin with that water pistol o' yours?</Text>
  <Text ID="255880">Hardly subtle now, is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="255881">Always keep yer shotgun under the table.</Text>
  <Text ID="255882">There's none who fears yer, if that's what yer think.</Text>
  <Text ID="255854">Time to hold up your end o' the bargain.</Text>
  <Text ID="255883">With the dirt she has on you, it'd be wise to help old Beryl.</Text>
  <Text ID="261231">Started a little war with your friend, hope that won't turn the milk sour between us.</Text>
  <Text ID="255855">Don't worry, I'll be sure to send the boys 'round.</Text>
  <Text ID="255884">You have my protection, I'm sure you'll pay for it later.</Text>
  <Text ID="255856">My defences may be a mite harder to spot than that.</Text>
  <Text ID="255885">The mood is grand in my camp, how about in yours? </Text>
  <Text ID="255886">Me orphans are tough, if you worry you may hurt 'em.</Text>
  <Text ID="255857">I've put my fair share of enemies overboard.</Text>
  <Text ID="255887">Disposing of the bodies is much easier at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="255888">All the evidence we had a war will sink to the bottom.</Text>
  <Text ID="255988">Do you look down yer nose at the little people? </Text>
  <Text ID="255989">Does what they be wanting not matter, now?</Text>

  <Text ID="252338">Finally, some plaudits.</Text>
  <Text ID="252339">I should say thanks.</Text>
  <Text ID="252340">Yes, yes. </Text>
  <Text ID="252341">Satisfactory.</Text>
  <Text ID="252342">I don't have time to agree every detail.. </Text>
  <Text ID="252343">It is not to my taste.</Text>
  <Text ID="252344">Not worth any more of my time!</Text>
  <Text ID="252345">No, it's not at all how I said I wanted it!</Text>
  <Text ID="252372">Will civilisation degenerate into decadence, or is decadence the defintion of civilisation?</Text>

  <Text ID="252399">My grand plans.</Text>
  <Text ID="252400">I'll set out the structure.</Text>
  <Text ID="252401">Allow me to illustrate.</Text>
  <Text ID="252402">A constructive proposal, I hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="252403">Time to drop the façade!</Text>
  <Text ID="252404">Let me be transparent.</Text>
  <Text ID="252405">I'll prick you with my compass!</Text>
  <Text ID="252406">I'll show you some perspective!</Text>
  <Text ID="252407">I am sympathetic.</Text>
  <Text ID="252408">Quite plain. </Text>
  <Text ID="252409">Adequate.</Text>
  <Text ID="252410">I think I can agree.</Text>
  <Text ID="252411">It has a symmetry.</Text>
  <Text ID="252412">Better go back to your drawing board.</Text>
  <Text ID="252413">It lacks definition.</Text>
  <Text ID="252414">There's no consistency of style!</Text>

  <Text ID="252459">Too much luggage and baggage!</Text>
  <Text ID="252460">I'm in the market for a new, reliable contractor!</Text>
  <Text ID="252437">Quite the juxtaposition, I know.</Text>
  <Text ID="252463">How about a hybrid interpretation?</Text>
  <Text ID="252438">I never saw what was in it for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252464">A forgettable collaboration.</Text>

  <Text ID="252495">Tasteful.</Text>
  <Text ID="252496">Well thought-out.</Text>
  <Text ID="252476">Banal.</Text>
  <Text ID="252497">It is folly!</Text>
  <Text ID="252498">How tawdry.</Text>
  <Text ID="252499">Cold as marble.</Text>
  <Text ID="252500">A garish display.</Text>
  <Text ID="252501">I always knew you were a Philistine!</Text>
  <Text ID="252477">Shameless egotism!</Text>
  <Text ID="252502">You would jeopardise Utopia!?</Text>
  <Text ID="252478">The future is never set in stone.</Text>
  <Text ID="252503">Let us historicise this conflict.</Text>
  <Text ID="252480">I cannot stand to see another scratch.</Text>
  <Text ID="252504">I agree protraction is necessary. </Text>
  <Text ID="252481">I think I've found a niche.</Text>
  <Text ID="252505">I'm all for creative forums.</Text>
  <Text ID="252506">Good, a supplier. Please don't let your tools lay about. </Text>
  <Text ID="252482">My suppliers are always letting me down! </Text>
  <Text ID="252507">I can trade ideas with myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="252508">Appalling selfishness!</Text>
  <Text ID="252485">I put friendships on pedestals for all to see.</Text>
  <Text ID="252511">Even if I don't have the time, it still suits. </Text>
  <Text ID="252486">We can all draw the blinds! </Text>
  <Text ID="252513">The veneer had rather peeled away.</Text>
  <Text ID="252490">My art is criminally under-funded. </Text>
  <Text ID="252517">Another of the faithful at my offertory.</Text>
  <Text ID="252520">Who says I don't care about others? After all, I need them to celebrate me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252526">Selfish? What's wrong with that?</Text>
  <Text ID="252527">Aloof and high-handed? Like god, then?</Text>
  <Text ID="252528">What's wrong with seeing a psychiatrist? I believe every genius needs one.</Text>
  <Text ID="252521">A rather arch compliment - veiled criticism, even.</Text>
  <Text ID="252529">Of what consequence are these waffled pleasantries? I strive for Xanadu!</Text>
  <Text ID="252530">An image too abstract even for me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252531">What an utterly trivial, throwaway remark.</Text>
  <Text ID="252522">Are you blind?! Will no-one understand the magnitude of my creations?</Text>
  <Text ID="252532">My street plan? Higgledy-piggledy?! SACRILEGE!</Text>
  <Text ID="252533">It is not a mid-life crisis! I have worn that yellow-flecked cravat at least twice!</Text>
  <Text ID="252534">Insolence! My work is significant, contemporary and deeply relevant!</Text>
  <Text ID="252523">I receive endless praise, but rarely given with such feeling.</Text>
  <Text ID="252535">Echoes my thoughts exactly, I don't believe in constructive critique.</Text>
  <Text ID="252536">Well said. Hold a mirror to heaven, and my cities are a worthy facsimile.</Text>
  <Text ID="252537">Fountain of youth, you say? Yes, perhaps I will live forever...</Text>
  <Text ID="254939">You are a stone, in the rough.</Text>
  <Text ID="254940">Your form often piques my interest.</Text>
  <Text ID="254941">I try to believe you a person of taste.</Text>
  <Text ID="254942">Wet clay may yet take shape.</Text>
  <Text ID="254943">An architect of your own destiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="254944">It's important to keep up appearances.</Text>
  <Text ID="254945">I am curious as to how you develop.</Text>
  <Text ID="254946">You're trending.</Text>
  <Text ID="254947">Will you ever meet my standard? </Text>
  <Text ID="254948">You can't polish a—everyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="254949">I doubt we'll ever have plurality of taste.</Text>
  <Text ID="254950">I keep only the finest around me.</Text>
  <Text ID="254951">I prefer my tools sharp.</Text>

  <Text ID="265581">My friends all have a lot of influence on the scene.</Text>
  <Text ID="265583">I too find them barbarian. </Text>
  <Text ID="265584">So you heard they were one of my critics?</Text>
  <Text ID="265582">Be careful where you cast your shadow…</Text>
  <Text ID="265576">Creeping up my esteemed friend's stair. </Text>
  <Text ID="265579">A concealed antechamber in the house of your enemy.</Text>
  <Text ID="265585">Important to seek new perspectives on one's rivals... </Text>
  <Text ID="256601">What vulgar showmanship.</Text>
  <Text ID="256602">Hmph, mere sandcastles!</Text>
  <Text ID="256603">Tasteless excess.</Text>
  <Text ID="256606">Spires gleam bright for myself also!</Text>
  <Text ID="256607">I have also been making progress, well done.</Text>
  <Text ID="256608">Embellishments can attract critical success.</Text>
  <Text ID="256598">I prefer interior design!</Text>
  <Text ID="256599">Some like a brash colonial style.</Text>

  <Text ID="260220">Don't lurk as if I am somehow past it!</Text>
  <Text ID="260221">What? I can't afford one of my pieces!</Text>
  <Text ID="260222">I firmly believe art should be shared by all.</Text>
  <Text ID="260223">You will never fully appreciate it! </Text>
  <Text ID="260224">You will turn majesty into a monstrosity.</Text>
  <Text ID="260225">Even a featureless desert can be Eden in the right hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="260226">This island is clay, and I am its sculptor.</Text>
  <Text ID="260227">An island with too many rough edges.</Text>
  <Text ID="260228">A chinless island. I myself won't work with such materials!</Text>
  <Text ID="260229">You cannot rewrite the history of art!  </Text>
  <Text ID="260230">This is the desecration of all human culture!</Text>

  <Text ID="252577">I have lost a great advocate, thanks to you!</Text>
  <Text ID="252552">That's one way of dealing with the critics.</Text>

  <Text ID="261439">It's important to explore different spaces.</Text>
  <Text ID="261440">Great art takes inspiration where it can.</Text>
  <Text ID="261441">One has to stay in touch with the zeitgeist.</Text>
  <Text ID="261442">Science really is the art nouveau!</Text>
  <Text ID="261443">New techniques can freshen things up, certainly.</Text>
  <Text ID="261444">A scientific verticality!</Text>
  <Text ID="261445">I have no time for modernism.</Text>
  <Text ID="261446">Technology at the expense of beauty.</Text>
  <Text ID="261447">Buried in the future, you lose the zeitgeist.</Text>
  <Text ID="250063">You look idle, do this, would you?</Text>
  <Text ID="250180">Here's something even you can handle.</Text>
  <Text ID="250181">You can serve as the soot-stained stoker aboard my runaway train!</Text>
  <Text ID="250182">It's deeply trivial, but I dare say that won't bother you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250183">See how magnanimous I am, giving you work.</Text>
  <Text ID="250077">Desperate to make something of yourself, I see.</Text>
  <Text ID="250184">Don't keep me waiting.</Text>
  <Text ID="250185">It's an honour to serve a von Malching.</Text>
  <Text ID="250064">So, you've managed to muddle through.</Text>
  <Text ID="250187">Not bad. I might use you again.</Text>
  <Text ID="250188">Are you sure that's everything? Very well.</Text>
  <Text ID="250189">Good, now scurry back to the sewer.</Text>
  <Text ID="250190">Now watch as I rake it all in!</Text>
  <Text ID="250065">Fustilarian flea! Waste someone else's time! </Text>
  <Text ID="250191">Scrimshank pleb! Don't expect any favours from me. </Text>
  <Text ID="250066">No wonder your name is mud.</Text>
  <Text ID="250192">Fluffed it? You zestless zounderkite!</Text>
  <Text ID="250193">Don't give me fimble-fambles, I deal in results.</Text>
  <Text ID="250194">What can possibly be the delay?</Text>
  <Text ID="250195">I'll have perished at this rate.</Text>
  <Text ID="250196">Where are you, dung-sifter?</Text>
  <Text ID="250197">Butter upon bacon, I have more for you …</Text>
  <Text ID="250198">There's no end to the profits in this.</Text>
  <Text ID="250199">I see a glimmer in this pan yet...</Text>
  <Text ID="250200">Surely you want to distance yourself from that simpleton?</Text>
  <Text ID="250201">Clearly not as distinguished a responsibility as this…</Text>
  <Text ID="255448">Give it here!</Text>
  <Text ID="255449">Cough up, will you!</Text>
  <Text ID="255450">Hand it over, nitwit.</Text>
  <Text ID="257173">What task can I give you? Everything's perfect.</Text>
  <Text ID="257174">You won't find any loose ends here.</Text>
  <Text ID="257175">Oh no, I think you should see to your own problems first.</Text>
  <Text ID="257176">Keep those gelatinous octopodes off my back!</Text>
  <Text ID="257177">Will you be my cannon fodder along the way?</Text>
  <Text ID="257178">Every Baron - which is what I am - should be escorted.</Text>
  <Text ID="250229">Von Malching is the name on everyone's lips at society gatherings.</Text>
  <Text ID="250230">I'd dress as your grandmother if it meant I could lay hands on your lovely lucre!</Text>
  <Text ID="250231">My business is other people's money. Your money, to be exact.</Text>
  <Text ID="250232">I shall capitalise on this.</Text>
  <Text ID="250233">Such juicy prospects.</Text>
  <Text ID="250234">Fizzing!</Text>
  <Text ID="250235">Very good for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="250236">The promise is ravishing!</Text>
  <Text ID="250237">That's good gravy!</Text>
  <Text ID="250238">Greatly to my advantage.</Text>
  <Text ID="250239">So, you can be useful.</Text>
  <Text ID="250241">I loathe to admit it, but you've done well.</Text>
  <Text ID="250242">Impressive, what's your secret? Not that I need it.</Text>
  <Text ID="250243">If you're happy with mediocre, then I'm happy too.</Text>
  <Text ID="250244">Well, bully for you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250245">Not entirely feeble. Not strong, but not feeble.</Text>
  <Text ID="250246">You might just be the best of a bad set.</Text>
  <Text ID="250247">I am vexed.</Text>
  <Text ID="250248">Confound this blasted matter. </Text>
  <Text ID="250249">This has upset my plans!</Text>
  <Text ID="250250">Absurd, I won't have it!</Text>
  <Text ID="250251">Nooooooooo! </Text>
  <Text ID="250252">Inconceivable!</Text>
  <Text ID="250253">What the devil?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250257">I expect no less, from a bluebottle.</Text>
  <Text ID="250258">Whenever it rains, you worm to the surface.</Text>
  <Text ID="250262">Your family crest is seething with rot!</Text>
  <Text ID="250263">You remind me of my father, spineless!</Text>
  <Text ID="250264">You handle this business like a guttersnipe.</Text>
  <Text ID="250265">You dare deny the cat his milk! </Text>
  <Text ID="250266">Your actions betray your commonness.</Text>
  <Text ID="250267">You're yet another mangy travelling circus, here today, gone tomorrow.</Text>
  <Text ID="250269">Don't expect me to shake your disease-ridden hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="250272">You, is it.</Text>
  <Text ID="250274">Oh I'm sorry, have we met?</Text>
  <Text ID="250275">Another interruption. Better be worth it.</Text>
  <Text ID="250276">What a deep voice I have. All the better to greet you with!</Text>
  <Text ID="250277">Want something, or simply admiring my realms?</Text>
  <Text ID="250278">Stumbling into the lion's jaws?</Text>
  <Text ID="250279">Good, then you know where the door is.</Text>
  <Text ID="250280">Don't loiter, you'll depreciate the value of this neighbourhood!</Text>
  <Text ID="250282">Keen to experience the dizzying razzle-dazzle of city life? </Text>
  <Text ID="250283">Ever seen a finer example than this? Of course you haven't.</Text>
  <Text ID="250284">Look upon the majesty, and weep.</Text>
  <Text ID="250285">Wish you had a vessel this stately do you?</Text>
  <Text ID="250286">I don't mind losing the odd sailor, as long as they bring in the bounty.</Text>
  <Text ID="250287">I associate boats with treasure.</Text>
  <Text ID="250288">We're looking for a deck-scrubber, since you like boats so much.</Text>
  <Text ID="250289">I deserve this.</Text>
  <Text ID="250290">Capital.</Text>
  <Text ID="250291">Bang up to the elephant.</Text>
  <Text ID="250292">Oh if I must.</Text>
  <Text ID="250293">Only because it suits me.</Text>
  <Text ID="250294">Alright.</Text>
  <Text ID="250295">An emphatic no!</Text>
  <Text ID="250296">Certainly not!</Text>
  <Text ID="250297">Has the world gone loopy?</Text>
  <Text ID="250301">The brutes are rich, and the meek impoverished, all is as it should be in the world!</Text>
  <Text ID="250302">My factories use every part of the pig but the squeal. Squeamish workers can be found other situations!</Text>
  <Text ID="250303">I sometimes feel for the little people; too busy working to earn any money.</Text>
  <Text ID="250304">I held a modest function for society's distinguished. A five-course dinner, a masquerade, a forty-piece orchestra, rose petals billowing from the rafters. Maybe I'll invite you next time, but then... maybe not.</Text>
  <Text ID="250305">Some were born, silver spoon in mouth. Once I'd wrenched it from father's feeble grasp that is.</Text>
  <Text ID="250306">Miss Jorgensen is an intriguing creature. Naïve, but of good blood. Once she replies to my offer of marriage, we shall breed children of ambition and status.</Text>
  <Text ID="250307">Since Miss Qing is rather new, I'll show her the lay of the land. Then have first dibs on her eastern fortune! </Text>
  <Text ID="250308">Beryl O'Mara clings to society like a leech. Her chief of police should arrest her where she stands.</Text>
  <Text ID="250309">Why do they celebrate that fop Gasparov at the club? All he does is blither about buttresses!</Text>
  <Text ID="250310">Why is it prattlers like Wibblesock are always so insistent?! Does the dratted imbecile never sleep?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250311">George Smith's hard life, blah-blah-blah. Haven't I had to struggle!? A name in tatters, and yet now, across everybody's lips!</Text>
  <Text ID="250313">Graves?! The mutation? The model of malificence?! The ripper who robbed the barber?</Text>
  <Text ID="250314">Vicente Silva has had an easy life; anybody in his boots would have succeeded. I meanwhile, rise to prominence on merit!</Text>
  <Text ID="250315">When Lady Hunt invited me in for afternoon tea, I felt an unspoken bond between us. Sophistication!</Text>
  <Text ID="250316">The Queen is fond of me, and vice-versa. But her administration is a scandal! I demand a barony!</Text>
  <Text ID="250317">Archie Blake is a sniveller. He somehow cosied up to the Queen, and has remained an obsequious parasite ever since.</Text>
  <Text ID="260892">Turning her back on the beau monde, Miss Harlow brings shame upon her family name. </Text>
  <Text ID="260893">Damn those pirates. Damn their greed!</Text>
  <Text ID="260894">Isabel Sarmento shakes the foundations of society! They should feed her to the lions!</Text>
  <Text ID="260895">I don't know where Kahina gets her prices!</Text>
  <Text ID="250324">We won't shake on it, you probably spit on your hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="250325">I pity you, is why I indulge you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250326">I'm a philanthropist,</Text>
  <Text ID="250327">Trade can be so demeaning.</Text>
  <Text ID="250328">And despite a yawning gulf in status. </Text>
  <Text ID="250329">Noblesse oblige!</Text>
  <Text ID="250330">Regard my largesse!</Text>
  <Text ID="250538">I'm glad of our trade, most are too dazzled by me to even approach.</Text>
  <Text ID="250539">I rarely circulate among minnows, yet we've done a few deals.</Text>
  <Text ID="250540">The little piglet that keeps coming back to the teat, its adorable.</Text>
  <Text ID="250361">My lavish offer.</Text>
  <Text ID="250362">Take it or leave it.</Text>
  <Text ID="250363">It's as low as I will stoop.</Text>
  <Text ID="250364">Read while I floss my moustache.</Text>
  <Text ID="250365">Me at my most generous.</Text>
  <Text ID="250366">You don't deserve better than this …</Text>
  <Text ID="250367">Don't waste my time with counter-offers! </Text>
  <Text ID="250368">I am a wolf, and you, a sheep come to dinner.</Text>
  <Text ID="250369">I'll scrape off your carapace you wood weevil!</Text>
  <Text ID="250370">I long to burst you like a bubo.</Text>
  <Text ID="250371">I have you between my fat palms ready to squish.</Text>
  <Text ID="250372">Quite reasonable, considering ...</Text>
  <Text ID="250373">Don't mind if I do.</Text>
  <Text ID="250374">What a steal!</Text>
  <Text ID="250375">See! I'm no miser!</Text>
  <Text ID="250376">A most favourable result.</Text>
  <Text ID="250377">Putrescent pinchfist!</Text>
  <Text ID="250378">And sign my life away?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250379">You stiff-neck scrooge!</Text>
  <Text ID="250380">A scandalous offer!</Text>
  <Text ID="250381">Skinflint!</Text>
  <Text ID="256141">I refuse to moot with a miser!</Text>
  <Text ID="256191">You got too greedy!</Text>
  <Text ID="256192">I'm not dealing with a scrooge!</Text>
  <Text ID="256193">Why transact with a pinchfist!</Text>
  <Text ID="256194">Why couldn't you just let me extort you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250382">I'll be the one who does the exploiting!</Text>
  <Text ID="250383">The fat needs trimming. </Text>
  <Text ID="250384">As I want it, or not at all…</Text>
  <Text ID="250385">You deranged rhinoceros!</Text>
  <Text ID="250386">This deal is good for me in any case.</Text>
  <Text ID="250387">Meal-mouth fitch.</Text>
  <Text ID="250388">I've seen scarier chipmunks.</Text>
  <Text ID="250389">Please, don't make me laugh!</Text>
  <Text ID="250390">What will you do? Pepper me with haberdasher's buttons?</Text>
  <Text ID="250391">You'll appreciate this.</Text>
  <Text ID="250392">Let me help you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250393">Here's charity.</Text>
  <Text ID="250394">No need to thank me.</Text>
  <Text ID="250395">And they say I'm unkind...</Text>
  <Text ID="250396">Well, what did you expect?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250397">Eat humble pie.</Text>
  <Text ID="250398">You pushed me to this.</Text>
  <Text ID="250399">You deserve even worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="250400">Let me put you in your place.</Text>
  <Text ID="250401">I wage war against you and your pigeon-liver plebs.</Text>
  <Text ID="250402">A war with you is a surefire investment. </Text>
  <Text ID="250403">House von Malching goes to war!</Text>
  <Text ID="250404">This war is a waste of time for both of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="250405">What if I were to let you off the hook?</Text>
  <Text ID="250406">Better let you catch your breath.</Text>
  <Text ID="250407">Towel off the sweat while you may.</Text>
  <Text ID="250408">It will help your exiguous business along.</Text>
  <Text ID="250409">I don't expect this favour will be repaid.</Text>
  <Text ID="250410">You would be joining an elite club.</Text>
  <Text ID="250411">You never had anything I needed.</Text>
  <Text ID="250412">We always seem to throw your junk into the sea. </Text>
  <Text ID="250413">Why I degraded myself to your level...! </Text>
  <Text ID="250418">Who would decline a match with a von Malching?</Text>
  <Text ID="250419">A most illustrious alliance, surely? </Text>
  <Text ID="250420">I am so tired of pretending to care about you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250421">We are patently not on the same footing.</Text>
  <Text ID="250427">Take it. I hardly need it. </Text>
  <Text ID="250428">Had it coming out of my ears - wax free, of course.</Text>
  <Text ID="250429">Here is a token gift.</Text>
  <Text ID="250438">For once something you've done makes sense.</Text>
  <Text ID="250439">That's not a terrible idea.</Text>
  <Text ID="250440">Oh, yes...</Text>
  <Text ID="250441">Most promising.</Text>
  <Text ID="250442">Surprisingly shrewd ...</Text>
  <Text ID="250443">Vagabond!</Text>
  <Text ID="250444">Tatterdemalion!</Text>
  <Text ID="250445">A bold-faced swindle!</Text>
  <Text ID="250446">The impudence!</Text>
  <Text ID="250447">A low-life move.</Text>
  <Text ID="250448">By jove, you're a maniac! </Text>
  <Text ID="250449">Your paper tigers will be blown to the winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="250450">War? All too obvious, you sneeze-lurking snake.</Text>
  <Text ID="250451">Finally worked out who's best?</Text>
  <Text ID="250452">I suppose I could spare you ...</Text>
  <Text ID="250453">I could have batty-fanged you to bits.</Text>
  <Text ID="250454">Yes, I do think you need time to recuperate.</Text>
  <Text ID="250455">Fine, though I doubt you have anything tradeworthy. </Text>
  <Text ID="250456">I keenly await your first shipment of soiled 'kerchiefs.</Text>
  <Text ID="250457">Trade with you? Lucky me.</Text>
  <Text ID="250458">No more of your junk? Say it's not true!</Text>
  <Text ID="250459">Finally we can be rid of your detritus!</Text>
  <Text ID="250460">Yes, go back to the foot of the pyramid.</Text>
  <Text ID="250465">Certainly I can be a friend, at least on paper.</Text>
  <Text ID="250466">Dry your eyes, I will be your ally. </Text>
  <Text ID="250467">Weaseling your way out?</Text>
  <Text ID="250468">Sloping your shoulders?</Text>
  <Text ID="250475">More money is always good.</Text>
  <Text ID="250476">Never look a gift donkey in the chops.</Text>
  <Text ID="250520">I've always dreamed of being loathed!</Text>
  <Text ID="250521">Au contraire! There is nothing more in fashion than the monocle!</Text>
  <Text ID="250522">Your guttaral babble sloshes like water off a duck's back!</Text>
  <Text ID="250523">The wayward jabs of your sabre are foiled by your lack of poise.</Text>
  <Text ID="250524">What sticky drippy honey goop!</Text>
  <Text ID="250525">Damn liberal! Control your peculiar thoughts!</Text>
  <Text ID="250526">What a fawning cod you have turned out to be.</Text>
  <Text ID="250527">Your toadyism is thoroughly nauseating!</Text>
  <Text ID="250528">Lies and slander! My wife died in a curricle accident!</Text>
  <Text ID="250529">I am nothing like my idiot father! You calumniating imp!</Text>
  <Text ID="250530">What's wrong with my moustache?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250545">I AM a real baron, I tell you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250531">Oh, yes. Couldn't have said it better myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="250532">Thank you! Pleasingly round isn't it?</Text>
  <Text ID="250533">Very true! They are extremely shiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="250534">I know your game of billiards, but don't let me stop you.</Text>
  <Text ID="254923">I'm confident I can still exploit you in some way.</Text>
  <Text ID="254924">You might hold potential yields.</Text>
  <Text ID="254925">There's something about you, gullibility perhaps.</Text>
  <Text ID="254926">I'm convinced you sit on a gold mine, that could be my mine.</Text>
  <Text ID="254927">Awful to think you might have nobody to confide in.</Text>
  <Text ID="254928">The closer we are, the more likely I am to inherit.</Text>
  <Text ID="254929">You have a whiff of innocence.</Text>
  <Text ID="254930">You know, we're so close, I'm almost in your pocket.</Text>
  <Text ID="254931">Why am I letting you near me!? </Text>
  <Text ID="254932">What was I thinking!</Text>
  <Text ID="254933">I'm disturbed you managed to lure me in.</Text>
  <Text ID="254934">Who needs family?</Text>
  <Text ID="254935">I believe you'd slow my runaway train!</Text>
  <Text ID="254936">So what if I am deeply prejudiced?</Text>
  <Text ID="254937">I've just been delving into your heritage.</Text>
  <Text ID="254938">What feeble creature is that on your coat-of-arms?</Text>
  <Text ID="265586">You rub shoulders with the elite.</Text>
  <Text ID="265587">You have to butter some muffins, on the way to the top.</Text>
  <Text ID="265589">Look at you worms tangling in the mud.</Text>
  <Text ID="265590">I don't like them, and I don't like you.</Text>
  <Text ID="265592">You humiliate yourself publicly!</Text>
  <Text ID="265593">It doesn't suit you to mingle with the upper crust.</Text>
  <Text ID="265595">Yes, there can only be one showmaster!</Text>
  <Text ID="265596">I love to see others squabbling among themselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="265588">Partridge-napper! That is my secret tunnel!</Text>
  <Text ID="265594">Imagine! Living a life of duplicity!</Text>
  <Text ID="265591">It would be naive not to keep an eye on them.</Text>
  <Text ID="265597">Everyone's doing it, are they not?</Text>
  <Text ID="256611">Who do you bribe to make such advances?!</Text>
  <Text ID="256612">What is this radicalism?</Text>
  <Text ID="256613">Best hope that ladder isn't swiped under you!</Text>
  <Text ID="256616">You've come a long way— heaven knows you needed to.</Text>
  <Text ID="256617">Well, well, look at the surging hoi polloi!</Text>
  <Text ID="256618">Further strides toward the unexceptional!</Text>
  <Text ID="256621">Squatter! I won't sue you, I'll ruin you!</Text>
  <Text ID="256622">Hornswoggling your way in?!</Text>
  <Text ID="256623">You rock-suckling barnacle! </Text>
  <Text ID="257061">I am a baron! Land is for me to own.</Text>
  <Text ID="257062">Fiend, stop grabbing it all!</Text>
  <Text ID="256624">I am the eagle, who swoops for juicy bits.</Text>
  <Text ID="256625">A miniscule gain, you must be very proud.</Text>
  <Text ID="256626">Can't see why that land was so enticing.</Text>
  <Text ID="257063">Must have been awfully cramped before…</Text>
  <Text ID="257064">What entitlement could you possibly hold?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250572">I bought some of your island. The door was open, and I ambled through.</Text>
  <Text ID="250573">Hardly worth investing in your island, but then, it won't be yours for long.</Text>
  <Text ID="250574">A delicious morsel. Soon I shall have the lion's share.</Text>
  <Text ID="250575">It can be mine now. All mine.</Text>
  <Text ID="250576">I have so many grand plans for it…</Text>
  <Text ID="250577">A completely insignificant island, no wonder you're so keen to buy! </Text>
  <Text ID="250578">You can afford to tussle for my island? Perhaps I underestimated you.</Text>
  <Text ID="250579">Only a fastidious cove thinks they can buy their way in!</Text>
  <Text ID="250580">You think you've outmaneuvered me!</Text>
  <Text ID="250581">Defraud me of an entire island?!</Text>
  <Text ID="250582">Sad you lack the acumen to see the potential of this land. </Text>
  <Text ID="250583">What kind of apple-polisher gives up an island?</Text>
  <Text ID="250586">You only have it because I let you have it!</Text>
  <Text ID="250587">You do the hard work developing it, and then I'll take it back.</Text>
  <Text ID="250590">You philistine! All my hard work gone from that island.</Text>
  <Text ID="250591">You erased every trace of von Malching from it?! Savage!</Text>
  <Text ID="250592">Razed every brick I laid? You are possessed by sadistic demons! </Text>
  <Text ID="250620">I'll smithereen you!</Text>
  <Text ID="250621">Lowly cur!</Text>
  <Text ID="250622">Have at you, devil-dog!</Text>
  <Text ID="250623">I'm positively bristling!</Text>
  <Text ID="250624">I am suddenly violent!</Text>
  <Text ID="250625">You wild beast!</Text>
  <Text ID="250626">You vindictive menace!</Text>
  <Text ID="250627">Your fleet is a rabble!</Text>
  <Text ID="250628">Plebs are not at liberty to joust!</Text>
  <Text ID="250629">Knave!</Text>
  <Text ID="250630">Oh dear, did your stock plummet?</Text>
  <Text ID="250631">I shall sweep your wreck for treasure!</Text>
  <Text ID="250632">Your tin-pot tars left clinging to driftwood!</Text>
  <Text ID="250633">That ship cost me an arm and a leg!</Text>
  <Text ID="250634">My ship, you electric eel!</Text>
  <Text ID="250635">Where did you find such firepower?</Text>
  <Text ID="250636">I should have charged the spectators! </Text>
  <Text ID="250637">It gave way so easily!</Text>
  <Text ID="250638">Have you any idea how much that cost?</Text>
  <Text ID="250639">That will be sickeningly expensive to replace!</Text>
  <Text ID="250640">Look at my winning smile!</Text>
  <Text ID="250641">It's my island now. Time to exploit the dissidents!</Text>
  <Text ID="250678">Brute force?! A fearful determination.</Text>
  <Text ID="250679">You didn't play fair! This wretched life is never fair.</Text>
  <Text ID="250642">Looks like I've trampled over you on my way to the top of the pile. </Text>
  <Text ID="250643">Nowhere left to run for the von Malching line. Be my surrogate, show them all... how to run a cut-throat business.</Text>
  <Text ID="250644">They was a valued business associate! </Text>
  <Text ID="250645">Don't rub out my allies! They could be useful!</Text>
  <Text ID="250646">You take care of my enemies, and I'll make mountains.</Text>
  <Text ID="250647">Yes, you create a distraction, while I fill my pockets.</Text>
  <Text ID="250648">I had you down as a lily-livered waif.</Text>
  <Text ID="250649">Rash. You almost have my respect.</Text>
  <Text ID="250650">A military gambit now?</Text>
  <Text ID="250651">Yes. Better to send your plebs to war.</Text>
  <Text ID="250652">I hear your officers call you 'pipsqueak'.</Text>
  <Text ID="250653">Playing tin soldiers?</Text>
  <Text ID="250654">You polish your blunderbuss like a pimpled cadet.</Text>
  <Text ID="250655">The bluster of a shoe-laced ruffian.</Text>
  <Text ID="250656">Honour our agreement, drive back these scoundrels!</Text>
  <Text ID="250657">You would not dare renege on our pact!?</Text>
  <Text ID="261320">I declared war on your friend; guarantee they will be your friend no longer!</Text>
  <Text ID="250658">Come at the drop of a hat? Only if I get a share of the spoils.</Text>
  <Text ID="250659">This feels like a first for me; honouring a deal I made.</Text>
  <Text ID="250660">Foxed your way into my hole!? Where's my rifle?</Text>
  <Text ID="250661">You'll soon be back here before a firing squad!</Text>
  <Text ID="250662">Enough meaningless talk, let's see how rich you are in a duel!</Text>
  <Text ID="250663">My slick sailors will string yours from their sails!</Text>
  <Text ID="250664">One fish in the vast school that will bring you to your patchwork knees!</Text>
  <Text ID="250665">These majestic cannons will shred your rag-tag sails.</Text>
  <Text ID="256014">That's it, show those greasy plebs what for! </Text>
  <Text ID="256015">Should be lined up for what they've done!</Text>
  <Text ID="256016">Disease?! And you seem to be its source. </Text>
  <Text ID="256017">I knew there was something putrescent about you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256825">How can so few words be so distracting?!</Text>
  <Text ID="256826">How do you fashion such alluring sentences?!</Text>
  <Text ID="256827">I want to bait them away from the truth! </Text>
  <Text ID="256789">Why waste it all on plebs, indeed!</Text>
  <Text ID="256790">I believe in hoarding too.</Text>
  <Text ID="256791">So easy to dupe them, isn't it?</Text>
  <Text ID="256792">I find newsprint is more than enough for them to chew on.</Text>
  <Text ID="256793">The suggestible pleb believes anything they read.</Text>
  <Text ID="256794">A few sheets of pulp, and the gutter is satisfied!</Text>
  <Text ID="256834">Then there is such a thing as bad publicity.</Text>
  <Text ID="256835">Do you not find these stories remotely embarrassing?</Text>
  <Text ID="256836">Have you seen the news, you are a laughing stock!</Text>
  <Text ID="265856">How dare you assail the noble Bente!</Text>
  <Text ID="265858">About time someone squished that locust!</Text>
  <Text ID="265860">You know, that filthy sewer rat has a mean bite.</Text>
  <Text ID="265868">You too would like her favour, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="265870">Two feathered twits bumping around the same coop.</Text>
  <Text ID="265872">Her sordid dynasty is somehow worthy of credit, isn't it?</Text>
  <Text ID="267997">Look at all those helpless beasts, ha ha!</Text>
  <Text ID="267998">Where did you source all of those gleaming exhibits?</Text>
  <Text ID="267999">You can't get succeed without getting a little soot on your hands!</Text>
  <Text ID="268001">They shouldn't be happy they should be in the gutter!</Text>
  <Text ID="268002">If they have time to mope, they have time to work!</Text>
  <Text ID="268003">Now you can exploit them somewhere else!</Text>
  <Text ID="268004">How far do you think being so nice is going to get you?</Text>
  <Text ID="268005">Squeeze out every last drop!</Text>
  <Text ID="268006">Pot plants and soft furnishings? What a waste!</Text>
  <Text ID="261164">Father failed you too, did he? You'll want to restore your family's soiled name. </Text>
  <Text ID="261165">Edvard's right, where is our royal fleet commission?</Text>
  <Text ID="267919">They probably did it for money— I would.</Text>
  <Text ID="267920">You would tell me if you discovered El Doo-dah out there, wouldn't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="261166">Of course, only a fool would have let Prosperity slip in the first place. The clue is in the name!</Text>
  <Text ID="261167">Family only ever hold us back.</Text>
  <Text ID="266592">You unstoppered the bottle and let the menace loose!</Text>
  <Text ID="266593">I was worried for a while there would be no Queen to grant me my baroncy.</Text>
  <Text ID="261448">Dabbling in disorganised crime?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261449">Who do you think you are, the scarlet pimple-nel?</Text>
  <Text ID="261450">Industrial sabotage!</Text>
  <Text ID="261451">Bamboozle me?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261452">Your blind mice have lost their tails!</Text>
  <Text ID="261453">How the devil did you find out!?</Text>
  <Text ID="261454">That is business these days.</Text>
  <Text ID="261455">Can't you see, everyone has spies!</Text>
  <Text ID="261456">Take my deception as a compliment!</Text>
  <Text ID="261457">No! No!! The fool was caught!</Text>
  <Text ID="261458">Your scientific dabbling is paying off. </Text>
  <Text ID="261459">Your science fixation doesn't look so freakish now! </Text>
  <Text ID="261460">Your ghoulish experimentations bear sublime fruit. </Text>
  <Text ID="261461">I should have the most fecund laboratories!</Text>
  <Text ID="261462">Why aren't my squares that brilliant?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261463">I want to profit from the scientific sphere!</Text>
  <Text ID="266445">How do you both look?</Text>
  <Text ID="266446">Oh that! I like to wear it in private.</Text>
  <Text ID="266447">Poppycock! Don’t be such a prude. How do you know I haven’t been wearing a tutu all along? You only ever see my top-half in-game.</Text>
  <Text ID="266448">What does everyone have against my tutu? I think it’s time you all took stock... / I hereby solemnly confess: / I wear a pink tutu / From late at night till morning dew / I wear a pink tutu / I wear a pink tutu. / Yes, thank heaven above! / Avoid me, belittle me / but oh how it flatters me / And fits me just like a glove. / I wear a pink tutu. / In contempt of my character rules / When I appear, It’s true / I wear most certainly / Something beneath made of tulle / I wear a pink tutu. / So before you begin to pooh-pooh / take time to scrutinise / please try to recognise / That I wear a pink tutu</Text>
  <Text ID="266449">No I refuse to be quiet / Now everything’s out in the light / If in loading screens, the harbour, / or in the trading menu / forever I’ll wear a tutu!</Text>
  <Text ID="266450">Good, then we can begin.</Text>
  <Text ID="266451">I did not know the queen was part of this. I thought we cut that witch out?</Text>
  <Text ID="266452">Oh golly-gosh, the nine!</Text>
  <Text ID="266453">quite feeble and small</Text>
  <Text ID="266454">The magic lies in the checksum</Text>
  <Text ID="266455">I thought we looked shit!</Text>
  <Text ID="266456">Nothing personal chum, but you look unspeakable.</Text>
  <Text ID="266457">No!</Text>
  <Text ID="266458">A shame he has taken it so badly. He thinks anno is so boring— he really looked forward to the musical.</Text>
  <Text ID="266459">He simply clicks fast forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266460">Then he fasts forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266461">They all fast-forward!</Text>
  <Text ID="266462">We fast forward, and forward…</Text>
  <Text ID="266463">No, wait. something’s wrong. The lighting should be  different somehow. The sun should be…</Text>
  <Text ID="266464">Where’s the ambulance?</Text>
  <Text ID="266465">No name to set things straight / The concept is rather hard to relate</Text>
  <Text ID="266466">Anyone have a light?</Text>
  <Text ID="266467">No! my tutu! / Oh horror! Oh pain! / All we see is made of paper!</Text>
  <Text ID="266468">All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?</Text>
  <Text ID="266469">All of it burns, my pink tutu!</Text>
  <Text ID="266470">Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.</Text>
  <Text ID="250072">Some find it titilating to serve. Is that you?</Text>
  <Text ID="251947">Can you do this without complaining pigcrap?</Text>
  <Text ID="251955">When you are hungry, really hungry, you'll eat anything.</Text>
  <Text ID="251956">They never gave me opportunity to show who I was.</Text>
  <Text ID="251957">Make fresh roses slither from this manure.</Text>
  <Text ID="250078">On your head be it.</Text>
  <Text ID="251948">It's on your head.</Text>
  <Text ID="251958">Quick, march!</Text>
  <Text ID="250073">My little errand boy, back with a happy face.</Text>
  <Text ID="251949">You're still excrement.</Text>
  <Text ID="251959">Humans are so cheap.</Text>
  <Text ID="255515">Never asked you how it felt to be bought?</Text>
  <Text ID="255516">Good dog.</Text>
  <Text ID="250074">You drop from the flesh before feeding is done...</Text>
  <Text ID="251950">God, this insect is an enigma!</Text>
  <Text ID="250075">Humans are flawed.</Text>
  <Text ID="251951">Watching you is like my lungs are filling with paraffin.</Text>
  <Text ID="255517">It's so sad to witness your degeneration.</Text>
  <Text ID="251952">What were you told, maggot?</Text>
  <Text ID="251960">Oh take your time, I've got your back.</Text>
  <Text ID="251961">I can only wait so long, before I snap…</Text>
  <Text ID="251953">Since your hands are dirty, there's more manure, warm and waiting.</Text>
  <Text ID="251962">There's no end to the tedium is there! </Text>
  <Text ID="251963">I have another task for stiff little soldiers like you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251954">Do not worship false idols.</Text>
  <Text ID="251964">Why not take the path drenched in viscera? It'll feel more real!</Text>
  <Text ID="255451">Don't tell me, you followed your orders?</Text>
  <Text ID="255452">How nice, is this for me? </Text>
  <Text ID="255453">It's always better not to come to me empty-handed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257179">Be careful what you wish for.</Text>
  <Text ID="257180">Soon, there'll be something to get your teeth into.</Text>
  <Text ID="257181">I can bring no meaning to your life just now.</Text>
  <Text ID="257182">I want you to watch.</Text>
  <Text ID="257183">Come, we're just friends on a little sea trip!</Text>
  <Text ID="257184">This could be nasty. Are you nasty?</Text>
  <Text ID="251861">My truth is the rattle of skulls on poles. Want a rattle, little baby?</Text>
  <Text ID="251876">Bathing in claret is good for the skin, I can be the one to show you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251877">They say I'm a God. But I'm more than that. I'm free.</Text>
  <Text ID="251862">Freedom on the tongue.</Text>
  <Text ID="251878">Great rainbows made of bones.</Text>
  <Text ID="251879">It's nice when rivers run red.</Text>
  <Text ID="251880">Ohhh! I'm going to enjoy this… </Text>
  <Text ID="251881">A feast day!</Text>
  <Text ID="251882">Is ecstasy.</Text>
  <Text ID="251883">Depravity is beauty.</Text>
  <Text ID="251863">How beautiful you are!</Text>
  <Text ID="251884">You try so hard to do good.</Text>
  <Text ID="251885">You're a puppet, you do right! </Text>
  <Text ID="251886">You're a noble creature, living a fantasy.</Text>
  <Text ID="251887">Stay good. Leave the evil to me. </Text>
  <Text ID="251888">Goodness turns to badness like alchemy. </Text>
  <Text ID="251889">I don't wanna hurt you, I wanna thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251864">Mash the eyeballs.</Text>
  <Text ID="251890">I need to inflict pain now.</Text>
  <Text ID="251891">Someone needs their brain scoopin' out.</Text>
  <Text ID="251892">It's so boring, so mundane. </Text>
  <Text ID="251893">I want to burn things.</Text>
  <Text ID="251894">I'll make a throne of bodies!</Text>
  <Text ID="251895">Suffocation, without the joy of suffocating. </Text>
  <Text ID="251865">You need to suffer.</Text>
  <Text ID="251896">I could twist your face.</Text>
  <Text ID="251897">I can release you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251898">I will diffuse you to the four winds.</Text>
  <Text ID="251899">You can be my new pastime.</Text>
  <Text ID="251900">I think you've earned the right to a slow death.</Text>
  <Text ID="251901">You have it coming to you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251866">Come a little closer, let me smell your skin. Don't worry, I don't bite. I gnaw. </Text>
  <Text ID="251902">If we meet again, I show you a fine time. I start with nostrils and an eiderduck feather.</Text>
  <Text ID="251867">We answer to natural law here.</Text>
  <Text ID="251903">Welcome to hell.</Text>
  <Text ID="251904">Our little heart of darkness.</Text>
  <Text ID="251905">Stick around, I have some free poles!</Text>
  <Text ID="251906">The army is risen. The time is ripe.</Text>
  <Text ID="251907">Reach out to me, so I can chop off your hands!</Text>
  <Text ID="251908">Is it you I smell?</Text>
  <Text ID="251868">Look at these ants, they like it here.</Text>
  <Text ID="251909">I ate there once.</Text>
  <Text ID="251910">Are you tempted to burn it? I'm tempted to burn it.</Text>
  <Text ID="251911">These dopes have no minds, but at least they admit it.</Text>
  <Text ID="251869">I'll lick salt crusts from her prow.</Text>
  <Text ID="251912">Bodies go below deck. Intensifies the stench.</Text>
  <Text ID="251913">When she sails home, I'm gonna kiss her face. </Text>
  <Text ID="251914">The sea oozes poison.</Text>
  <Text ID="251870">Gratification.</Text>
  <Text ID="251920">I toast this cup of blood to my saviour.</Text>
  <Text ID="251921">It almost tastes like freedom.</Text>
  <Text ID="251871">Yes.</Text>
  <Text ID="251922">Is lucky I agree.</Text>
  <Text ID="251923">Better hope its worth it.</Text>
  <Text ID="251872">No, I say!</Text>
  <Text ID="251924">What's that? </Text>
  <Text ID="251925">Non, non, non.</Text>
  <Text ID="251873">I've been in the jungle a long time. I like it. We are animals. Animals!</Text>
  <Text ID="251926">Kill history, then kill the people who made it all up. Carve a new history - whatever suits you!</Text>
  <Text ID="251927">I opened my chest with a comb. Now I know, I don't have a heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="251928">Take a machete and split it clean through. Then chop into halves, and eat while it's still fresh.</Text>
  <Text ID="251929">Gods have rules, commandments. Rules are there for breaking, like heads.</Text>
  <Text ID="251930">They want to write books about me? Songs? Who is going to be left to enjoy them?</Text>
  <Text ID="251874">A wild, sweet memory. A whorl of her sanguine fabrics. And the wind whispers her name; Jorgensen.</Text>
  <Text ID="251932">Princess Qing must be saved from this nightmare. I pray she doesn't ask me.</Text>
  <Text ID="251933">George always has to do it the right way. It's boring. When will be the massacre?</Text>
  <Text ID="251934">O'Mara is a skittering moth, playing a nocturne under a trivial moon. </Text>
  <Text ID="251935">Carl Leonard von Midas? He has ass's ears.</Text>
  <Text ID="251936">Margaret Hunt has seen beyond the curtain. Look at her eyes, she has seen it. </Text>
  <Text ID="251937">Silva, your Queen, cannot stop the liquidation of Empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="251938">Isabel wastes herself on the moral.</Text>
  <Text ID="251939">Jean fights for people. Don't fight for people, fight against them.</Text>
  <Text ID="251940">I still have the medal Sir Archibald gave me. I must give it back to him some day. </Text>
  <Text ID="251875">We intertwine.</Text>
  <Text ID="251941">It's ok, you can keep your hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="251942">Like filthy alley cats.</Text>
  <Text ID="251943">It's all a charade.</Text>
  <Text ID="251944">May we rub up again.</Text>
  <Text ID="251945">Next time I kill you.</Text>
  <Text ID="251946">I feel close to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252135">How I crave the rush, of our every  exchange! </Text>
  <Text ID="252150">I like the way you scuttle in and out with your trade ships.</Text>
  <Text ID="252151">I should turn these tables, and flay you from my temple.</Text>
  <Text ID="251996">Lay down before God!</Text>
  <Text ID="252004">Fear brought you here. Face what is beneath the cowl.</Text>
  <Text ID="252005">Does blood weep from your eyes?</Text>
  <Text ID="252006">Open yourself up to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252007">I've come to weigh your heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="252008">Words, where only actions speak.</Text>
  <Text ID="252009">My little piglet, come to market.</Text>
  <Text ID="251998">Drowning or burning?</Text>
  <Text ID="252010">I've measured you for my wall.</Text>
  <Text ID="252011">I have a keen flint in my hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="252012">Do you like violence?</Text>
  <Text ID="251999">Can't you see I'm smiling?!</Text>
  <Text ID="252013">As night is night.</Text>
  <Text ID="252014">Kind avarice.</Text>
  <Text ID="252015">I hope you won't trust me now.</Text>
  <Text ID="252016">Greed is perfection.</Text>
  <Text ID="252000">No. Can I set you on fire now?</Text>
  <Text ID="252017">Your dung doesn't interest me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252018">Where is your sense of depravity?</Text>
  <Text ID="252019">You defile my temple with your lies.</Text>
  <Text ID="252020">No, you pigcrap.</Text>
  <Text ID="256142">Enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="256195">I'm too bored, I'm sorry.</Text>
  <Text ID="256196">I'm fresh out of patience.</Text>
  <Text ID="256197">Mundane, go away.</Text>
  <Text ID="256198">I can't carry on, it hurts me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252001">I make the rules!</Text>
  <Text ID="252021">This or nothing!</Text>
  <Text ID="252022">No. Good.</Text>
  <Text ID="252002">I love how you rage.</Text>
  <Text ID="252024">More! Let it all out.</Text>
  <Text ID="252025">Wonderful! Bathe yourself in anger!</Text>
  <Text ID="257370">Rattle the cage! No-one can hear you. </Text>
  <Text ID="257371">You're like a mutt on a chain.</Text>
  <Text ID="257372">A wasp whining under a glass.</Text>
  <Text ID="252028">Free yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="252053">Embrace it.</Text>
  <Text ID="252054">Open your eyes.</Text>
  <Text ID="252055">Touch the other side.</Text>
  <Text ID="252056">Give yourself up.</Text>
  <Text ID="252029">I want you to hurt.</Text>
  <Text ID="252057">I will break you…</Text>
  <Text ID="252058">I am fear…</Text>
  <Text ID="252059">Obey your master…</Text>
  <Text ID="252060">Kneel, dog.</Text>
  <Text ID="252030">I want your head in a basket.</Text>
  <Text ID="252061">It's harvest time…</Text>
  <Text ID="252062">I'm setting you free.</Text>
  <Text ID="252031">I will always treasure the scars you gave me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252063">Let's look back on the exquisiteness of war.</Text>
  <Text ID="252032">Replenish your anger.</Text>
  <Text ID="252064">I can only pray the carnage will resume soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="258381">The urges seem to pass for a while.</Text>
  <Text ID="252033">Just a drop of your plasma to seal the deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="252065">Our trade bodies intersect.</Text>
  <Text ID="252066">I crave your firkins.</Text>
  <Text ID="252034">Our artery ruptures.</Text>
  <Text ID="252067">See saw Margery Daw, Jacky shall have a new master…</Text>
  <Text ID="252068">I tire of this busy-work.</Text>
  <Text ID="252037">A blood pact.</Text>
  <Text ID="252069">I've already cut my palm for you …</Text>
  <Text ID="252038">We should sever ourselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="252070">I hope you don't end up feeling detached.</Text>
  <Text ID="252041">I really had to sift a lot of skin for that.</Text>
  <Text ID="252071">Now the money is disgorged, you keep it.</Text>
  <Text ID="252072">A token of my affection.</Text>
  <Text ID="252091">What a frisson.</Text>
  <Text ID="252108">Temptation.</Text>
  <Text ID="252109">Gratifying.</Text>
  <Text ID="252110">It soothes…</Text>
  <Text ID="252111">A real thrill.</Text>
  <Text ID="252092">Hissssssssss!</Text>
  <Text ID="252112">Pigcrap.</Text>
  <Text ID="252113">Excremental.</Text>
  <Text ID="252114">Your tiny mind!</Text>
  <Text ID="252115">Out of your box!</Text>
  <Text ID="252093">Come to me lamb, I will release you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252116">To destroy me, you must destroy yourself. Can you do that?</Text>
  <Text ID="252117">Your end can be your beginning.</Text>
  <Text ID="252094">I just want you to feel safe.</Text>
  <Text ID="252118">Perhaps you are unready for the final ritual. </Text>
  <Text ID="252095">Yes, I'd prefer if we took it slow.</Text>
  <Text ID="252119">You want it drawn out? By all means.</Text>
  <Text ID="252096">You're signing your life away…</Text>
  <Text ID="252120">Yes, why not share an artery?</Text>
  <Text ID="252121">Ah, the venal sin of currency!</Text>
  <Text ID="252097">I'll consider it dissolved.</Text>
  <Text ID="252122">Do keep in touch.</Text>
  <Text ID="252123">Oh. Was my handshake a little firm?</Text>
  <Text ID="252100">We can exchange stories of great atrocities.</Text>
  <Text ID="252125">I really hope I can make you see differently.</Text>
  <Text ID="252101">So easy for humans to change their faces.</Text>
  <Text ID="252126">Don't stop, let red rage overflow your cup!</Text>
  <Text ID="252105">What are these primitive discs, pigcrap? I'm intrigued. </Text>
  <Text ID="252128">Money is a sad reality.</Text>
  <Text ID="252130">Oh pigcrap, you can do better than that.</Text>
  <Text ID="252136">Frankly that sounds delicious. Please, go on...</Text>
  <Text ID="252137">Is that your diagnosis doctor? Are you going to give me my medicine now?</Text>
  <Text ID="252138">Is this praise? I'm confused. It sounds like praise.</Text>
  <Text ID="252131">I find all living things beautiful, except parasites.</Text>
  <Text ID="252139">You know, you grovel at the perfect height for a passing hammer...</Text>
  <Text ID="252140">If you were that devoted, you'd have graced my shrine with an offering - any cut will do.</Text>
  <Text ID="252141">Another came before you, bearing pineapples. But he enjoyed them more than I did.</Text>
  <Text ID="252132">Deserter?! Humanity is a desert. A clutch of hollow skulls between the dunes of entropy.</Text>
  <Text ID="252142">That was before my metamorphosis - a name dead to me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252143">Did I ever tell you about the time I turned a man inside-out?</Text>
  <Text ID="252144">Please, that is a word I don't like. I beg you, call us pigs.</Text>
  <Text ID="252133">Your words make me wonder, are you the one the omens said would come?</Text>
  <Text ID="252145">Not all my mites are so fervent. I will keep a wedge of flesh back for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252146">How enlightened, at least as much as pigcrap humans can be.</Text>
  <Text ID="252147">That does sound like my work...and lice you say? Just wonderful.</Text>
  <Text ID="255374">I feel the skeleton of something good.</Text>
  <Text ID="255376">You don't need to be an insect like the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="255377">Your horizon is darkness. That's good.</Text>
  <Text ID="255378">I augur good things for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255379">Imagine, we could be fine friends someday.</Text>
  <Text ID="255380">I have you down as a listener.</Text>
  <Text ID="255381">I don't know if I'd chop you up rightaway.</Text>
  <Text ID="255382">I believe in you, really I do.</Text>
  <Text ID="255375">You are not the chosen one.</Text>
  <Text ID="255383">When I think of you, I think drudgery.</Text>
  <Text ID="255384">You will always be a perishing wallflower.</Text>
  <Text ID="255385">I do not see outrage in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255386">The locusts, whenever they speak of you, sound sad.</Text>
  <Text ID="255387">It's not me, it's you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255388">Too human.</Text>
  <Text ID="255389">You will never escape yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="265598">Isn't friendship great?</Text>
  <Text ID="265599">We are getting along so well!</Text>
  <Text ID="265601">It makes me angry, watching you two frolic.</Text>
  <Text ID="265602">What you are doing with them hurts me. </Text>
  <Text ID="265604">It's damaging us both. </Text>
  <Text ID="265605">Cut them out, and I cut you out.</Text>
  <Text ID="265607">Why not, let's skin them together! </Text>
  <Text ID="265608">Yes, bad people! Naughty people!</Text>
  <Text ID="265600">Will I tell them I've seen you lurking?</Text>
  <Text ID="265606">I make friends so as to kill them, don't you slither in! </Text>
  <Text ID="265603">I like your furtiveness! </Text>
  <Text ID="265609">A snake? I go for the jugular myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="256627">You've built up a head of steam. Shall I vent it?</Text>
  <Text ID="256628">You're in bloom. Where are my secateurs…</Text>
  <Text ID="256629">Heads above the parapet get lopped.</Text>
  <Text ID="256637">You defile land special to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="256638">Trespassers in the sacred lands must be eaten.</Text>
  <Text ID="256639">Don't stretch yourself too thin.</Text>
  <Text ID="257065">Your sty is growing, pigcrap.</Text>
  <Text ID="257066">Man can't grow forever, it has to stop!</Text>
  <Text ID="252156">I'll gently harvest the wheatfields of your soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="252177">Greed, pure greed; it has a vice-like grip.</Text>
  <Text ID="252178">Funny how a few flaxen discs confer such absurd power.</Text>
  <Text ID="252157">I will feast upon this body of land… </Text>
  <Text ID="252179">It will be a nice new playground… </Text>
  <Text ID="252158">While you barter for a strip of my skin, I'm out in the woods looking for a rug.</Text>
  <Text ID="252180">Money is soaked in bloody fingerprints, remember that.</Text>
  <Text ID="252181">La Corona tried to buy me out. I burst their bubble.</Text>
  <Text ID="252159">If you eat it from the inside out, I may reciprocate. </Text>
  <Text ID="252182">That island is very precious to me. </Text>
  <Text ID="252160">Pigcrap let me have the island, believes anything they say.</Text>
  <Text ID="252183">With your blessing, anything I do here will feel legitimate now.</Text>
  <Text ID="252162">Settling like a butterfly? I have a great passion for lepidoptera.</Text>
  <Text ID="252185">Sad to see the place go. So many happy memories.</Text>
  <Text ID="252164">All I made upon that island removed. Admirable conviction.</Text>
  <Text ID="252187">Cleansed all trace of me? You are made in my own image.</Text>
  <Text ID="252188">All trace of me expunged from your island, how liberating.</Text>
  <Text ID="252189">I crush you like velvet.</Text>
  <Text ID="252208">I caress destruction.</Text>
  <Text ID="252209">Satisfy my thirst.</Text>
  <Text ID="252210">Humans are so ugly!</Text>
  <Text ID="252211">Fire and brimstone!</Text>
  <Text ID="252190">Your violence sustains me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252212">Hurt me, I deserve it.</Text>
  <Text ID="252213">Feed me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252214">Balm me with your animus.</Text>
  <Text ID="252215">Nourish me!</Text>
  <Text ID="252191">Drowning is always a favourite.</Text>
  <Text ID="252216">Like Atlantis, sunk to the deep.</Text>
  <Text ID="252217">Kneel before Poseidon.</Text>
  <Text ID="252192">You animal!</Text>
  <Text ID="252218">Yes, drown my pathetic sailors!</Text>
  <Text ID="252219">It's a mercy for them, the incompetents.</Text>
  <Text ID="252193">Let's watch it crumble together!</Text>
  <Text ID="252220">I sweep it away like gingerbread!</Text>
  <Text ID="252194">Yes, give in to your thirst for destruction!</Text>
  <Text ID="252221">Destroy! You were born to destroy!</Text>
  <Text ID="252195">It's for the best. Your island was going nowhere. </Text>
  <Text ID="252222">Your island is free now.</Text>
  <Text ID="252206">What brutality, if I may say so.</Text>
  <Text ID="252223">Take it, you've earned it. I'll get you back later.</Text>
  <Text ID="252196">Look into my eyes. I want to see the light fade before I harvest your husk.</Text>
  <Text ID="252197">Regrets? I wish I had done more cooking; I always had the temperament of a chef.</Text>
  <Text ID="252198">Killing my ally cannot hurt me, no.</Text>
  <Text ID="252224">I have no need of friends. Kill them.</Text>
  <Text ID="252199">I would like to see the body, if it is still all in one place.</Text>
  <Text ID="252225">I almost regret seeing the bad ones find release.</Text>
  <Text ID="252200">What is life without death?</Text>
  <Text ID="252226">Let fury engulf your mortal vessel! </Text>
  <Text ID="252227">Let terror lead you to deliverance.</Text>
  <Text ID="252228">Unshackle your mind, and swing its chains.</Text>
  <Text ID="252201">Don't fight, it's pointless. You are pointless.</Text>
  <Text ID="252229">Pigcrap, your forces are fat to be rendered.</Text>
  <Text ID="252230">Why don't you save your effort for the end.</Text>
  <Text ID="252231">I know you're keen, but it's not time yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="252202">I know on some occasion we agreed together, we'd feast on their offal.</Text>
  <Text ID="252232">Our bodies shall fuse violently, pigcrap, against those wretches. </Text>
  <Text ID="261322">I am about to hurt your friend. Wanna join in?</Text>
  <Text ID="252203">A puppy chases your sheep, so you call a wolf for help!</Text>
  <Text ID="252233">But of course I'll join you; we are bound to the covenant.</Text>
  <Text ID="252204">Please, erase me. Tear down my wickednesses.</Text>
  <Text ID="252234">Topple this Babel. I have been proud and must be punished.</Text>
  <Text ID="252235">I see visions of white walls misted red with blood.</Text>
  <Text ID="252205">They are hungry; I rubbed their noses in your scent.</Text>
  <Text ID="252236">Finally it's getting exciting. I'm so thrilled you can be taken apart.</Text>
  <Text ID="252237">BOOOOOOM!</Text>
  <Text ID="256024">Looks like the party's started!</Text>
  <Text ID="256025">Isn't it nice to see people out and about.</Text>
  <Text ID="256028">Disease is Mother Nature's cull.</Text>
  <Text ID="256029">Sick in the body as well as the head.</Text>
  <Text ID="256030">Playing God!? </Text>
  <Text ID="256031">Humans cannot fight their natures.</Text>
  <Text ID="256032">It really seems to be hotting up over there.</Text>
  <Text ID="256033">Oh, I've been burning things too.</Text>
  <Text ID="256034">Oh will you let Rome burn?! </Text>
  <Text ID="256035">You put it out. Why can't you live a little? </Text>
  <Text ID="256798">What's black, white and red all over? I think you already know...</Text>
  <Text ID="256799">A delicious war article, it makes me foam at the mouth.</Text>
  <Text ID="256800">Your paper makes it sound like war is inevitable!</Text>
  <Text ID="265880">Don't think you can have her skull… </Text>
  <Text ID="265881">Then the prows of your ships point east.</Text>
  <Text ID="265882">Yes, I can't wait for him to die.</Text>
  <Text ID="265883">Him? He's almost passed over already!</Text>
  <Text ID="265884">Skewer her little urchins on toothpicks!</Text>
  <Text ID="265885">Burn the false prophet to the ground!</Text>
  <Text ID="265886">Perhaps you can bury him alive in gold.</Text>
  <Text ID="265888">Perhaps you can pin another medal on him, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="265889">And keep a lid on her ashes so she can't remanifest.</Text>
  <Text ID="265890">Those teenage tantrums must end some day!</Text>
  <Text ID="265891">Let's see who has the better luck.</Text>
  <Text ID="265892">My two favourite birds, now sit invitingly on the same perch.</Text>
  <Text ID="267928">High walls and flowers won't conceal the gore.</Text>
  <Text ID="267929">The splenetic, iron-sweet whiff of the warmonger… </Text>
  <Text ID="261168">So, your father was a traitor, eh? Sounds like my sort of fellow!</Text>
  <Text ID="261169">Why lose your head over a family scandal, when you could be losing it in so many more interesting ways?!</Text>
  <Text ID="267903">Puzzling, yes! I love a good mystery.</Text>
  <Text ID="267904">Off to the colonies as royal ambassador? You may end up the tray of hors d'oeuvres!</Text>
  <Text ID="261170">Welcome to the jungle!</Text>
  <Text ID="261171">Wow your family is really messed-up!</Text>
  <Text ID="266569">About time we saw some chaos!</Text>
  <Text ID="266570">The denizens of night have returned to their crack in the wall, for now.</Text>
  <Text ID="261464">Skulk in shade, guillotine blade.</Text>
  <Text ID="261465">Hide like a coward!</Text>
  <Text ID="261466">I have a sneaking suspicion…</Text>
  <Text ID="261467">Your emissaries curl like salted slugs. </Text>
  <Text ID="261468">I have blunted your dagger of espion. </Text>
  <Text ID="261469">Tentacles grow back.</Text>
  <Text ID="261470">I must be omnipresent.</Text>
  <Text ID="261471">They are my feelers, my antennae.</Text>
  <Text ID="261472">They foreshadow the coming frenzy.</Text>
  <Text ID="261473">Thank you for returning my cloak and dagger.</Text>
  <Text ID="261474">Science gives you new tools. I like new tools.</Text>
  <Text ID="261475">Your progress really gave me a jolt. </Text>
  <Text ID="261476">I also like to experiment.</Text>
  <Text ID="261477">I could make you my guinea pig?</Text>
  <Text ID="261478">Yet you fail to answer the fundamental questions.</Text>
  <Text ID="261479">I prefer practise to theory.</Text>
  <Text ID="252621">A mission of great tactical import.</Text>
  <Text ID="252622">Attention cadet! I have orders for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252623">Worthwhile, no matter how much you hate empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="252624">Don't fail me, or there will be ramifications!</Text>
  <Text ID="252625">When I issue a task, I expect it carried out. Understand?</Text>
  <Text ID="252626">You are free to go now.</Text>
  <Text ID="252627">Very good, on your way.</Text>
  <Text ID="252628">Until your return.</Text>
  <Text ID="252629">You make a good minion.</Text>
  <Text ID="252630">Bravo, Bravo.</Text>
  <Text ID="252631">Good, soldier.</Text>
  <Text ID="252634">Oh yes, or why not comb monkeys instead! Feel free!</Text>
  <Text ID="252635">My, what a sense of duty!</Text>
  <Text ID="252636">If I could I'd have you court-martialled!</Text>
  <Text ID="252637">You bear a pigeon standard.</Text>
  <Text ID="252638">Don't come to me looking crestfallen!</Text>
  <Text ID="252639">Delay, and enter dangerous waters.</Text>
  <Text ID="252640">Time determines victory from defeat.</Text>
  <Text ID="252641">Your urgency, is very important to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252642">Soldiers must be ready to adapt.</Text>
  <Text ID="252643">You would be helping a great cause...</Text>
  <Text ID="252644">If your conscience is clear, empire needs you yet...</Text>
  <Text ID="252645">If you have a choice, always make the right one.</Text>
  <Text ID="252646">Come, when is empire ever wrong?</Text>
  <Text ID="255454">Well? Don't be shy!</Text>
  <Text ID="255455">Mission accomplished?</Text>
  <Text ID="255456">Done your duty?</Text>
  <Text ID="257185">Stand easy, I have no new orders for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="257186">Whoever told you I needed help was fibbing.</Text>
  <Text ID="257187">I give the orders, as and when I see fit!</Text>
  <Text ID="257188">Escorts should scout ahead, anticipate trouble.</Text>
  <Text ID="257189">Protect your superiors on their voyage.</Text>
  <Text ID="257190">You will lead the charge, an exhilarating responsibility!</Text>
  <Text ID="261172">You're lucky your family's treachery is not pertinent to La Corona.</Text>
  <Text ID="261173">If the Empire is building a fleet, I better start building one too…</Text>
  <Text ID="267917">You have discovered your opponent's move. Isn't it time you made yours?</Text>
  <Text ID="267918">If I find out you've been meeting with rebels! </Text>
  <Text ID="261174">Sarmento is a sworn enemy of La Corona. One day we will deal with her rabble once and for all.</Text>
  <Text ID="261175">If real justice were done, Prosperity would still belong to La Corona, like back in the old days!</Text>
  <Text ID="266590">I could hire these Pyrphorians as mercenaries— defeat that nuisance Sarmento.</Text>
  <Text ID="266591">Hmmn I wonder if fire could fit in with my strategy...</Text>
  <Text ID="252647">A man of action, yet well-read, dressed, and drilled. What more could you want?</Text>
  <Text ID="252648">Barrack beds, early mornings and drill squares. All for the ultimate purpose.</Text>
  <Text ID="252649">History will remember me well, since I am to rewrite it for La Corona.</Text>
  <Text ID="252650">Simple logistics.</Text>
  <Text ID="252651">Effort is everything. </Text>
  <Text ID="252652">Bodes well for the campaign ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="252653">Proof there is time for my nation yet! </Text>
  <Text ID="252654">La Corona smiles! </Text>
  <Text ID="252655">Yet another victory!</Text>
  <Text ID="252656">All falling into place, naturally.</Text>
  <Text ID="252657">They said you were good, so it appears.</Text>
  <Text ID="252658">Where did you school?</Text>
  <Text ID="252659">Good to see you know your drills. </Text>
  <Text ID="252660">You can be proud, soldier. </Text>
  <Text ID="252661">I better start taking you seriously.</Text>
  <Text ID="252662">No stain on your reputation. </Text>
  <Text ID="252663">Seems I have competition.</Text>
  <Text ID="252664">Am I the only one here with a brain?</Text>
  <Text ID="252665">I'm going to need every hour God sends. </Text>
  <Text ID="252666">I won't give up, not now. </Text>
  <Text ID="252667">A failure is never the end.</Text>
  <Text ID="252668">I'm not pessimistic, I'm realistic.</Text>
  <Text ID="252669">For the love of La Corona!</Text>
  <Text ID="252670">How am I to command amid such incompetence?! </Text>
  <Text ID="252671">I think I have the measure of you. </Text>
  <Text ID="252672">Insubordination! </Text>
  <Text ID="252673">You're a laughing stock!</Text>
  <Text ID="252674">Have you forgotten your rank?! </Text>
  <Text ID="252675">I'd sit you on a cannonball, and fire you out to sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="252676">You need a dose of naval discipline! </Text>
  <Text ID="252677">I will not be played for a fool! </Text>
  <Text ID="252678">Yes I already know who you are. I? I am Admiral Vicente Silva.</Text>
  <Text ID="252679">I, Silva, have the executive power of a nation, but for you, I won't need it. </Text>
  <Text ID="252680">Pastel de nata?</Text>
  <Text ID="252681">Speak; my clerk will put it all on record.</Text>
  <Text ID="252682">Getting away from the action, are we?</Text>
  <Text ID="252683">Please, sit. Have an almond, or a fig.</Text>
  <Text ID="252684">What brings you out of your shell?</Text>
  <Text ID="252685">Now then, what must you be after?</Text>
  <Text ID="252686">So what if Empire's bad for everyone else - it's good for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252687">Governed as they think they want to be, that's the secret.</Text>
  <Text ID="252688">People want to be shepharded, I don't need to wave my crook.</Text>
  <Text ID="252689">My model town would be a barracks, divided into squares.</Text>
  <Text ID="252690">Never rule as a general, but pretend you're a civilian.</Text>
  <Text ID="252691">Navigation is more than part of our national history.</Text>
  <Text ID="252692">La Corona was always an empire of seafarers, there's salt in our blood.</Text>
  <Text ID="252693">I hope you know your flags and semaphore?</Text>
  <Text ID="252694">I know every knot in every plank - no admiral should ever rise so high they forget.</Text>
  <Text ID="252695">I can always rely on support.</Text>
  <Text ID="252696">There may be a reward in time.</Text>
  <Text ID="252697">Let's give ourselves a pat on the head.</Text>
  <Text ID="252698">It's not my funeral. </Text>
  <Text ID="252699">Agreed.</Text>
  <Text ID="252700">I give my word.</Text>
  <Text ID="252701">I don't think so.</Text>
  <Text ID="252702">Not worth any more of my time!</Text>
  <Text ID="252703">Non! I will not! </Text>
  <Text ID="252704">We must bivouac without brandy, and kayak without a paddle, on the road to victory.</Text>
  <Text ID="252705">We must have imagination to lead, yet in war, nothing is left to the imagination.</Text>
  <Text ID="252706">You better hope you've done your reading. Preparation is everything.</Text>
  <Text ID="252707">Think your Queen has no disputed colonies, and freely grants independence when asked politely?</Text>
  <Text ID="252708">La Corona, your Queen; empire is empire, a force of unstoppable destruction.</Text>
  <Text ID="261072">I took this command because it has always been my destiny. Under my leadership, La Corona shall once more be victorious.</Text>
  <Text ID="252709">Until La Corona is in open war with the Empire, your Queen is as much a friend as any.</Text>
  <Text ID="252710">Princess Qing gave me a fine copy of the "Art of War". Of course I've read it a thousand times. </Text>
  <Text ID="252711">Alonso's tactics are rash and confused, if he succeeds it will be down to luck!</Text>
  <Text ID="252712">Hunt plays the old battleaxe, waiting to drop the decisive blow.</Text>
  <Text ID="252713">La Fortune's days of piracy are numbered, La Corona will make sure of that!</Text>
  <Text ID="252714">Artur needs to look up the definition of "man" in the dictionary.</Text>
  <Text ID="252715">Isabel's rebels can't hide forever, the long arms of La Corona will soon tickle them out.</Text>
  <Text ID="252716">Von Malching doesn't realise, it's not about money, it's about power.</Text>
  <Text ID="252717">Why spree at Kahina's Emporium, when you can extract these goods at source?</Text>
  <Text ID="252721">Deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="252722">A supply line secured.</Text>
  <Text ID="252723">It all adds up.</Text>
  <Text ID="252724">I'm not here to make friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="252725">My accounts are suitably adjusted.</Text>
  <Text ID="252726">Then it's settled.</Text>
  <Text ID="252727">Just as I thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="252879">We have established an unbreakable chain of supply.</Text>
  <Text ID="252880">Your steady trade is helping change the course of history!</Text>
  <Text ID="252881">Your constant business is what empires thrive upon.</Text>
  <Text ID="252742">I do have the advantage of experience.</Text>
  <Text ID="252743">Ask for anything you wish, you won't get it.</Text>
  <Text ID="252744">Let's do this by the book.</Text>
  <Text ID="252745">Allow me to preside over our discussions.</Text>
  <Text ID="252746">Don't overthink it!</Text>
  <Text ID="252747">Come, this is your moment!</Text>
  <Text ID="252748">Take up your pen, and sign!</Text>
  <Text ID="252749">You have no choice but to concede.</Text>
  <Text ID="252750">Save your breath.</Text>
  <Text ID="252751">A necessary deterrent.</Text>
  <Text ID="252752">I do not suffer fools gladly…</Text>
  <Text ID="252753">It advantages us both.</Text>
  <Text ID="252754">I'm still dubious as to its merits. </Text>
  <Text ID="252755">A lie we can agree upon.</Text>
  <Text ID="252756">Precisely as I see it.</Text>
  <Text ID="252757">I'm inclined to agree.</Text>
  <Text ID="252758">What sort of peasant do you think I am?</Text>
  <Text ID="252759">You ignore the plain facts.</Text>
  <Text ID="252760">Utter caprice.</Text>
  <Text ID="252761">Who taught you this drivel?</Text>
  <Text ID="252762">What dullard's scheme is this?</Text>
  <Text ID="256143">I don't have to put up with this.</Text>
  <Text ID="256199">Rage quit!</Text>
  <Text ID="256200">This is pointless. Pointless!</Text>
  <Text ID="256201">If you're going to be stupid about it!</Text>
  <Text ID="256202">Oh forget it then!</Text>
  <Text ID="252763">It's for your own good.</Text>
  <Text ID="252764">See your error now?</Text>
  <Text ID="252765">Must I fix everything?</Text>
  <Text ID="252766">What are the odds? </Text>
  <Text ID="252767">I yield.</Text>
  <Text ID="252768">Touche.</Text>
  <Text ID="252769">Have you not seen my medals?</Text>
  <Text ID="252770">You could at least try to sound menacing.</Text>
  <Text ID="252771">Come now, really.</Text>
  <Text ID="252772">The finer things…</Text>
  <Text ID="252773">How's your latin?</Text>
  <Text ID="252774">No need to read the fine print.</Text>
  <Text ID="252775">A show of altruism can be a tactic.</Text>
  <Text ID="252776">The honourable thing I suppose.</Text>
  <Text ID="252777">Can't you see? I'm playing you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252778">I know you inside-out.</Text>
  <Text ID="252779">A little test.</Text>
  <Text ID="252780">I'll keep it brief.</Text>
  <Text ID="252781">Just playground games.</Text>
  <Text ID="252782">You become an unacceptable nuisance. </Text>
  <Text ID="252783">You are all that stands between victory and I.</Text>
  <Text ID="252784">I'm afraid war is my mission in life.</Text>
  <Text ID="252785">Lucid minds do not bear grudges. </Text>
  <Text ID="252786">Now, now, there has been anguish enough! </Text>
  <Text ID="252787">Cease-fire at once! </Text>
  <Text ID="252788">This is your last chance of a truce.</Text>
  <Text ID="252789">I too am a pragmatist, you see.</Text>
  <Text ID="252790">Good tacticians take any advantage they can get. </Text>
  <Text ID="252791">I need you to supply the front line.</Text>
  <Text ID="252792">I'm cutting your supply off at the pass.</Text>
  <Text ID="252793">My armies have bread enough to march on.</Text>
  <Text ID="252794">Victory depends on consistent supplies!</Text>
  <Text ID="252799">You could make a useful ally. </Text>
  <Text ID="252800">What say we take the high ground? </Text>
  <Text ID="252801">Alliances fail, history proves it. </Text>
  <Text ID="252802">Doesn't really matter whose side you're on. </Text>
  <Text ID="252809">Let's resolve things the way honourable people do.</Text>
  <Text ID="252810">I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.</Text>
  <Text ID="252811">This, my good friend, is a bribe.</Text>
  <Text ID="252817">I'm warming to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252818">Sunlight to lizards.</Text>
  <Text ID="252819">Thought you might.</Text>
  <Text ID="252820">Not much of a surprise.</Text>
  <Text ID="252821">Nothing special.</Text>
  <Text ID="252822">That's just silly!</Text>
  <Text ID="252823">Hardly conducive…</Text>
  <Text ID="252824">Contemptible.</Text>
  <Text ID="252825">Petty.</Text>
  <Text ID="252826">Incendiary.</Text>
  <Text ID="252827">Never interrupt your enemy… </Text>
  <Text ID="252828">I shall await your forfeiture in due course.</Text>
  <Text ID="252829">It's your funeral.</Text>
  <Text ID="252830">Yes, a glorious peace… </Text>
  <Text ID="252831">Stalemate.</Text>
  <Text ID="252832">Very well, but there's no use drawing this out. </Text>
  <Text ID="252833">Fine, but it'll only be a matter of time.</Text>
  <Text ID="252834">Just for necessities, nothing more.</Text>
  <Text ID="252835">Every soldier needs his rations.</Text>
  <Text ID="252836">I hope you'll have something for dry skin?</Text>
  <Text ID="252837">Who doesn't trade? You just embarrass yourself. </Text>
  <Text ID="252838">Is this revenge? I don't understand. </Text>
  <Text ID="252839">Are you a trader or are you not?</Text>
  <Text ID="252844">I say learn from anyone, no matter their station.</Text>
  <Text ID="252845">If you can't beat Empire, join it, eh? </Text>
  <Text ID="252846">Do you know something I don't?</Text>
  <Text ID="252847">And you would say that I'm arrogant.</Text>
  <Text ID="252854">What can you give the man who has everything? More!</Text>
  <Text ID="252855">A bribe? Very good.</Text>
  <Text ID="252860">Better to be short than short on brains!</Text>
  <Text ID="252861">Oh, the vacuous vocab of the lower-middle classes.</Text>
  <Text ID="252862">School was a long time ago, I am a master now.</Text>
  <Text ID="252863">No-one looks as super-silly-ous as you do at present!</Text>
  <Text ID="252864">Practice your pathetic attempts at flattery elsewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="252865">Don't drool over me, you melon.</Text>
  <Text ID="252866">My boots don't need any more spittle thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="252867">Yes well, I don't place much value in shows of emotion.</Text>
  <Text ID="252868">There is no reason I should let your comments about my proud nation get to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="252869">We are stronger day-on-day! This empire will never be forgotten, never!</Text>
  <Text ID="252870">She never said the word boring! And it was I who chose to break it off!</Text>
  <Text ID="252871">'89 was not a defeat! It was a tactical retreat!..and my first command!</Text>
  <Text ID="252872">A greasy little epithet, but I'll give you marks for trying.</Text>
  <Text ID="252873">Respect for your superiors, the sign of a reliable soldier.</Text>
  <Text ID="252874">Flattery is it? Then call me flattered.</Text>
  <Text ID="252875">"Despite my privilege I'm not so bad?" I'll take that as a compliment. </Text>
  <Text ID="255350">You should know, I have misgivings about you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255351">When I think about it, we aren't well-matched.</Text>
  <Text ID="255352">A Luso always watches the horizon.</Text>
  <Text ID="255353">I have never needed friends.</Text>
  <Text ID="255354">Talent won't manifest without discipline.</Text>
  <Text ID="255355">Under scrutiny, I think you regress.</Text>
  <Text ID="255356">Call me old-school, but I don't have to "like" anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="255357">Your standing suffers an about-face.</Text>
  <Text ID="255358">My view on you hasn't changed.</Text>
  <Text ID="255359">You could still be infantry material.</Text>
  <Text ID="255360">If you could recognise them, you'd have good qualities.</Text>
  <Text ID="255361">I've heard enough to think better of you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255362">Opinion swings are common in statecraft.</Text>
  <Text ID="255363">Current affairs show you in a favourable light.</Text>
  <Text ID="255364">You warrant further examination.</Text>
  <Text ID="255365">I'm still trying to size you up.</Text>
  <Text ID="265610">Strong allies are key to success. </Text>
  <Text ID="265611">We all need people we can trust.</Text>
  <Text ID="265613">I was wrong to think we shared a common foe. </Text>
  <Text ID="265614">I think you are confused as to who your friends are.</Text>
  <Text ID="265616">A pretty poor gambit to irk my allies.</Text>
  <Text ID="265617">A weak move, that's my ally. </Text>
  <Text ID="265619">A pincer movement!</Text>
  <Text ID="265620">Yes, an attack on two fronts!</Text>
  <Text ID="265612">The least-honourable strategy toward my allies…</Text>
  <Text ID="265618">Cowards go behind friend's backs. </Text>
  <Text ID="265615">I don't blame you for watching your back around them. </Text>
  <Text ID="265621">Our enemy's ranks will crumble from within.</Text>
  <Text ID="256643">Sail full of wind, no rudder in sight.</Text>
  <Text ID="256644">Advance with caution.</Text>
  <Text ID="256645">Hearing about your achievements bores me to tears.</Text>
  <Text ID="256648">Change takes bold leadership.</Text>
  <Text ID="256649">You've stolen a march on our enemies.</Text>
  <Text ID="256650">Routine progress through the ranks.</Text>
  <Text ID="256653">Rash, don't you think?</Text>
  <Text ID="256654">What are you building, an empire?!</Text>
  <Text ID="256655">You'll soon know the difference between quality and quantity.</Text>
  <Text ID="257069">And how are you going to manage all of those outposts?</Text>
  <Text ID="257070">You don't seem to know what risk is.</Text>
  <Text ID="256656">Thirst for conquest; one of my indulgences.</Text>
  <Text ID="256657">Strategic expansion, centralised power.</Text>
  <Text ID="256658">Difficult terrain - I'm impressed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257071">Gains require blood, sweat and tears, happily not ours.</Text>
  <Text ID="257072">Ambition is important, the best of us have it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260250">A good leader uses every weapon at their disposal.</Text>
  <Text ID="260252">As you see I've never struggled for money.</Text>
  <Text ID="260253">As you see, the family wealth is considerable.</Text>
  <Text ID="260255">This island needs proper leadership… </Text>
  <Text ID="260256">Be honest, the responsibility is too much for you. </Text>
  <Text ID="260257">Only empires can assimilate!</Text>
  <Text ID="260258">I never agreed you could be a shareholder! </Text>
  <Text ID="260259">Every man and his dog has money these days.</Text>
  <Text ID="260260">This island is crucial, you'll ruin everything! </Text>
  <Text ID="260261">You can't just go waltzing in!</Text>
  <Text ID="260262">I'm glad you gave it up without a fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="260263">Thanks for giving me a view of the battlefield.</Text>
  <Text ID="260264">An insignificant little acreage.</Text>
  <Text ID="260265">I only care for strategic outposts.</Text>
  <Text ID="260266">Pillage marks the depraved, and the doomed.</Text>
  <Text ID="260267">Those who go too far always regret it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260268">The complete debellation of my legacy.</Text>
  <Text ID="252882">Do your duty men!</Text>
  <Text ID="252883">Rout them!</Text>
  <Text ID="252884">Positions!</Text>
  <Text ID="252885">Charge!</Text>
  <Text ID="252886">In line of battle.</Text>
  <Text ID="252887">You won't catch me off guard! </Text>
  <Text ID="252888">Go on I dare you! </Text>
  <Text ID="252889">At my own game?</Text>
  <Text ID="252890">Evasive maneuvers!</Text>
  <Text ID="252891">Formations! </Text>
  <Text ID="252892">Bad for your morale! </Text>
  <Text ID="252893">Surrender.</Text>
  <Text ID="252894">The coup de grâce.</Text>
  <Text ID="252895">Do you really need to fully sink them?</Text>
  <Text ID="252896">Yes, well it's a Pyrrhic victory.</Text>
  <Text ID="252897">Hardly a triumph is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="252898">Not cruel unless I need to be.</Text>
  <Text ID="252899">Carthago delenda est.</Text>
  <Text ID="252900">Toppled by a pawn.</Text>
  <Text ID="252901">Never admit a mistake. </Text>
  <Text ID="252902">You must have feared this would happen.</Text>
  <Text ID="252903">I'm not one for long speeches.</Text>
  <Text ID="252905">Surely the decisive blow, no need to rub it in is there?</Text>
  <Text ID="252906">That's it. Why bother now. You've got everything.</Text>
  <Text ID="252907">Ha! HA! I got you. You my friend, have met your Water closet. I'm the king of the castle, you're the dirty rascal!</Text>
  <Text ID="252908">That's it! I refuse to be part of this farce any more. You cheated. Cheated all the way along! It's the only possible hypothesis.</Text>
  <Text ID="252909">The enemy is anyone who isn't your friend!</Text>
  <Text ID="252910">My complex plans to conquer my ally, gone to waste!</Text>
  <Text ID="252911">I can cross that off the list.</Text>
  <Text ID="252912">I was going to take care of that myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="252913">Your troops have fire in their bellies.</Text>
  <Text ID="252914">You can never overprepare.</Text>
  <Text ID="252915">Burnishing your battalia?</Text>
  <Text ID="252916">All present and correct, I see.</Text>
  <Text ID="252917">Haven't you heard the jangle of my medals?</Text>
  <Text ID="252918">You're not equipped to lead.</Text>
  <Text ID="252919">Paper, scissors, sink like a stone.</Text>
  <Text ID="252920">Reading tactics? Didn't know you read.</Text>
  <Text ID="252921">The moment we both have waited for. War is upon us! </Text>
  <Text ID="252922">This should prove a memorable victory for our alliance.</Text>
  <Text ID="261323">I have declared war on your ally, so you'd better choose carefully.</Text>

  <Text ID="254664">I have never asked anything of you, firstborn. Not when you stole away a-tiptoe, leaving the family burden at your little sister’s door, nor in the hard years that since have followed.</Text>
  <Text ID="266696">Our father is accused of high treason. Dare you to believe it? Arrested, stripped of his knighthood. We...I am terribly shaken, and the vultures are already circling.</Text>
  <Text ID="266715">Will you now stand by, knowing gentle father is endungeoned? It must kill him. Please come home. We need you.</Text>
  <Text ID="268881">I have never asked anything of you, firstborn... Not when you stole away a-tiptoe, leaving the family burden at your little sister’s door ... Our father is accused of high treason, dare you believe it! ... Will you now stand by, knowing gentle father is endungeoned? ... It must kill him... Please come home, we need you...</Text>
  <Text ID="253925">Is it really you, dearest sibling? I never dared hope you’d return. Do you remember Bright Sands? Of course you do; we loved it here. It’s changed now. The Royal Council support Uncle Edvard. Father barely cold, and he’s pulling everything down.</Text>
  <Text ID="253926">Never told your friend of Goode and Sons? There is much to be said, but not now. Dear father’s funeral begins.</Text>
  <Text ID="253927">No matter so few are here, when they are the few he loved most.</Text>
  <Text ID="253928">We shall, dear sibling, for now. I have acquired a small island with the last of my funds, and passage for all still loyal to father. Together we shall clear his name or die trying.</Text>
  <Text ID="266716">Edvard registered the debt officially?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266736">Please Miss Sarmento, we come here only to prove our father innocent— Samuel Goode.</Text>
  <Text ID="266743">I don't know about you, but my father would never have betrayed his Queen!</Text>
  <Text ID="266744">We are very sorry to hear your situation, still I must insist our father's...</Text>
  <Text ID="266894">Maybe nothing need be sunk at all, majesty!</Text>
  <Text ID="266895">Regard here, your Majesty! The Prosperity contract and our father's diary. The signatures do not match!</Text>
  <Text ID="266896">And now compare with a freight document by our uncle Edvard. Do you see? He forged the signature in order to impersonate father!</Text>
  <Text ID="266898">We hear you Isabel, but first we return to Bright Sands and confront uncle Edvard. His wicked masquerade is over!</Text>
  <Text ID="266922">Gather your things Edvard. For your trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="266923">No!</Text>
  <Text ID="266924">Samuel will forgive you on the other side, Edvard!</Text>
  <Text ID="266996">See! Her Majesty is paying her last respects, just as Archie promised!</Text>
  <Text ID="266997">From now on they rest side by side in the family vault.</Text>
  <Text ID="266998">She is...</Text>
  <Text ID="266999">Bright Sands is returned to us, father's name is cleared. So, that will be all, eldest. Will you and Aarhant be leaving?</Text>
  <Text ID="267005">I will not be fooled, Aarhant. I know that we shall one day be parted. But if my prayers be answered, today will not be that day— dearest sibling? Today is not a day for parting.</Text>
  <Text ID="267030">What do you do here at the family crypt, Edvard? Do you vaunt your betrayal?</Text>
  <Text ID="267031">Enough! It was you who sold Prosperity for the Pyrphorians! You forged father's signature! You sentenced him to death! But now the sentence is on you, uncle!</Text>
  <Text ID="267032">And your guilt shall long outlive you, uncle. Look what you've done to our family.</Text>
  <Text ID="267158">How dare you...</Text>
  <Text ID="267159">Father would never have! He was the Queen's stalwart, a member of the Royal Council, he...</Text>
  <Text ID="264970">Help enough to demolish the larger ruins. Let's breathe some life into this place!</Text>
  <Text ID="264971">Father wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our hands while our one prospect was in such a state.</Text>
  <Text ID="264972">So let's gather our townsfolk and ask them to spruce the place up.</Text>
  <Text ID="264973">Mourning is eased now we have others for company, sibling.</Text>
  <Text ID="264974">Your people are recovered, and desirous to proceed. Set them to it! We're going to need as much space as we can clear.</Text>
  <Text ID="264979">Let Uncle Edvard scoff. A modest island yes, but if you’re at all like Father, you’ll look beyond appearances. </Text>
  <Text ID="265063">We are running low on timber, but there's plenty in the ruins. We should clear some to stock up.</Text>
  <Text ID="264976">We must shelter the good, loyal people who have shown solidarity with our family.</Text>
  <Text ID="264977">We need every hand we can get if we are to expunge this debris.</Text>
  <Text ID="264978">It's been a hard day of labour for us all, we should cater to our tired, hungry people!</Text>
  <Text ID="264980">Timber, very good. I’ll try not to think of the coffin.</Text>
  <Text ID="264981">He twists every article in his favour, at our and father’s expense!</Text>
  <Text ID="265041">See what slander Edvard prints in Bright Sands!</Text>
  <Text ID="266512">If only father were here, he'd have known what to do. </Text>
  <Text ID="266515">It is not nearly as moribund here as it was. </Text>
  <Text ID="266516">Those still loyal to Father will now turn to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266517">A moving tribute to see so many loyal to father trust in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266518">At such times it is good to occupy oneself with routine things.</Text>
  <Text ID="266519">I'm sure you know, but father was innocent. </Text>
  <Text ID="266520">We must behave as if father were acquitted, as he one day will be.</Text>
  <Text ID="266521">Aarhant is proving wise counsel. I'm glad you manged to make a friend while you were away.</Text>
  <Text ID="266522">In times such as these, it is good to have people around us. </Text>
  <Text ID="266523">I'll dream of Bright Sands until the day I can dream no more.</Text>
  <Text ID="264988">You have father’s fortitude! These people will follow you as  they once followed him.</Text>
  <Text ID="264998">Is there no limit to Uncle's shameless demands?</Text>
  <Text ID="264999">I feel sick to the stomach that Edvard could ask so much of us so soon after father's death.</Text>
  <Text ID="265000">That miserly, uncharitable…dastard! Picking and choosing what he inherits! </Text>
  <Text ID="265050">Clearly Uncle's intention is to keep us  from ever owning a shipyard.</Text>
  <Text ID="264990">Speak to our humble cousin! He writes of a worker riot in Bright Sands.</Text>
  <Text ID="264991">It seems we are not alone in our contempt for Edvard.</Text>
  <Text ID="265053">Our dream of a shipyard is impossible without plenty of qualified hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="265054">Workers can handle stubborn debris on Ditchwater. If it's to be the centre of our new enterprise it needs to be immaculate.</Text>
  <Text ID="265055">Maybe Edvard will try to prevent us owning a shipyard, but for now let's at least house those workers. </Text>
  <Text ID="264994">Even I am astonished he could be this corrupt. We must put their cases before the highest authority, and hope for a retrial. </Text>
  <Text ID="265002">It cannot be...these names are those father trusted most; barristers, doctors, academics.</Text>
  <Text ID="265003">However much we despise Uncle Edvard, it's criminal to go opening his private correspondence!</Text>
  <Text ID="264995">I am so relieved our legitimacy is no longer in question. </Text>
  <Text ID="264997">Hurry, I already smell the tar, see the masts a-swaying from father’s study!</Text>
  <Text ID="264989">We have to set personal feelings aside and do as Edvard asks.</Text>
  <Text ID="266583">Edvard  becomes a monster inconceivably grotesque, but one we for now must keep fed.</Text>
  <Text ID="266584">As this letter proves them innocent, let us hurry to Sir Archibald. </Text>
  <Text ID="266585">For almost the first time since he passed, eldest, my heart is lifted.</Text>
  <Text ID="266586">Building a shipyard is no small matter, our work is far from finsihed.</Text>
  <Text ID="266587">Father would be ashamed to see his brother now.</Text>
  <Text ID="266588">I shall not be a content with any ship, until I can say it is one we ourselves have built.</Text>
  <Text ID="266589">The ship is another serendipity we should be grateful for.</Text>
  <Text ID="266197">A commission for the Royal fleet! And in such quantity! A rare honour indeed!</Text>
  <Text ID="266198">I find myself looking up to you, as the youngest often will.</Text>
  <Text ID="266202">The weaponry they ask for presents a problem. I'm not even sure we have an iron lode, do we? </Text>
  <Text ID="266207">I see the iron is beyond our reach. We have no choice but to find a way through the mountain.</Text>
  <Text ID="266206">What are you both doing! Demolition is a serious matter wanting proper expertise!</Text>
  <Text ID="266205">Father used Mr. Ticker on account of his good sense. Go, on, I suggest you find him in Bright Sands.</Text>
  <Text ID="266204">Ah, he’s here. Try to make a good first impression, eldest; any friend of father is a friend of ours.</Text>
  <Text ID="266224">Iron into Steel, Steel into Arms and we shall have fulfilled our first Royal commission!</Text>
  <Text ID="266225">There is no shame in producing weapons if it is in defence of the realm, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266767">Granting such a prestigious commission shows the council may be willing to give us fair hearing.</Text>
  <Text ID="266768">The last moneys I spent on Ditchwater appear well spent, eldest— and the faith I invested in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266769">This could be the start of something significant for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="266770">I'm sure if we have iron deposits, you can find them eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266771">If the royal fleet is to be at the cutting edge, we must start producing steel. </Text>
  <Text ID="266772">Steel! How proud father would be.</Text>
  <Text ID="266773">You have put in as much hard work as anyone else!</Text>
  <Text ID="266774">To outfit our ships, we're going to need to fashion all that steel into weaponry.</Text>
  <Text ID="266775">Perhaps we should sell ships to partners father trusted</Text>
  <Text ID="266776">I predict inexhaustible demand for our steel!</Text>
  <Text ID="266777">We are the beating heart of industry in the Empire.</Text>
  <Text ID="266778">Exactly the sort of mischief I remember you by.</Text>
  <Text ID="266779">Mr.Ticker has years of experience in detonations, we must secure his services.</Text>
  <Text ID="266780">Who would kill such a gentle man? Why?</Text>
  <Text ID="266215">I knew all along Father could never have taken his own life. But that someone willfully took his...!</Text>
  <Text ID="266242">It is father's diary! Quickly, what does he say!?</Text>
  <Text ID="266243">Of course - the island over which he was accused of treason! That is what they are after.</Text>
  <Text ID="266246">The diary may not be enough in itself to convince Sir Archibald, but it may give him food for thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="266247">No doubt father thought this symbol germane. If anyone can interpret it, Madame Kahina can.</Text>
  <Text ID="266260">Sarmento's last location is all we have. We need to plan our expedition route carefully. </Text>
  <Text ID="266860">You look into this, eldest. I'm not sure I can face it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266874">This is what we wanted after all. To know the truth.</Text>
  <Text ID="266875">What could he have meant, eldest? I fear this mystery is only just begun.</Text>
  <Text ID="266876">I now have more questions than answers, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266877">Father's killer was a nobody. Something greater conspires against our family.</Text>
  <Text ID="266878">Oh we are swept up in something now, eldest. And I am coming with you…</Text>
  <Text ID="266879">I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering such mysteries.</Text>
  <Text ID="266880">I wonder if Sir Archibald knows of this Pyrphorian threat? I think we have enough here to beg his  consideration again…</Text>
  <Text ID="266882">Where is the contract that would be official proof of Prosperity's sale?</Text>
  <Text ID="266883">Be careful, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266884">It relates the sale of the island  Prosperity—the very reason father was branded a traitor. </Text>
  <Text ID="266885">We cannot let the truth sink into the murk!</Text>
  <Text ID="266886">Father’s own hand! Now we shall know his mind, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266887">Don’t be afraid to ask Madame Kahina, she became a good friend to father.</Text>
  <Text ID="266888">Kahina is acquainted with the new world, she is sure to have seen this symbol before.</Text>
  <Text ID="266889">All we have is Isabel’s last-known hideaway, and a world of unknowns in between.</Text>
  <Text ID="266890">Prosperity is the cause of all this trouble. I already despise that wretched place.</Text>
  <Text ID="266891">I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering mysteries.</Text>
  <Text ID="266892">If you are going to do this, I am coming with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266893">At last the expedition has found Miss Sarmento. Let us hope she makes our journey worthwhile.</Text>
  <Text ID="267000">I'll do anything to know the truth, even if it mean dealing with Isabel's rogues.</Text>
  <Text ID="267010">As it stands, they are an easy target for the Pyrphorians. We should help, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="267011">You have done more to protect her people than Isabel could possibly have hoped, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="267012">From what we know of the Pyrphorians, I don't think it's enough yet to deter them.</Text>
  <Text ID="267013">Prosperity— I want to see the island that caused all this with my own eyes.</Text>
  <Text ID="267014">Then the Pyrphorians wanted Prosperity for the oil. No doubt to keep their fires burning.</Text>
  <Text ID="267015">I think we can ask anything of Isabel with her people sheltered, defended and now supplied.</Text>
  <Text ID="267016">This is about as much as she can ask for before she gives us a a bone to chew.</Text>
  <Text ID="267017">Isabel is showing genuine gratitude. Perhaps she isn't the sort I thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="267018">For the first time in my life, I know freedom.</Text>
  <Text ID="267019">Isabel claims to know the whereabouts of the contract, and it is the only trail we have.</Text>
  <Text ID="267020">I am so glad we are finally seeing the world together, eldest. </Text>
  <Text ID="267021">There it is— Prosperity. The source of all our troubles.</Text>
  <Text ID="267022">These fires cannot be due to the warm climate.</Text>
  <Text ID="267023">The firemen confirm it was arson! These fires were set upon us!</Text>
  <Text ID="267024">This monstrous fire-raising is deliberate. The Pyrphorians!</Text>
  <Text ID="267025">Isabel is mistaken. I won't hear these lies about father.</Text>
  <Text ID="267026">Why has Isabel not yet given us the Prosperity contract? She is worryingly elusive on the subject.</Text>
  <Text ID="267027">Isabel plays on our emotions. Still, if the sick could be carried to La Isla to convalesce…</Text>
  <Text ID="267028">A messenger boy has brought us a letter.</Text>
  <Text ID="267029">It is in Isabel's interest we find that contract! The Queen will realise she was forced into a deal.</Text>
  <Text ID="267242">I'm no more experienced in espionage than you, eldest. But this is our one chance to uncover the truth.</Text>
  <Text ID="267264">We have to make this count, eldest. That contract will reveal all.</Text>
  <Text ID="267265">You've gotten it! I never knew you had the ingenuity!</Text>
  <Text ID="267266">It is father's signature, but in Edvard's hand! Edvard was behind this!</Text>
  <Text ID="267267">I believe Sir Archibald when he says Her Majesty may do something drastic.</Text>
  <Text ID="267268">Well done Eldest! You have served both Isabel and the Empire greatly.</Text>
  <Text ID="267269">If this is the only way to get to the truth, then we must follow it.</Text>
  <Text ID="267270">I know it's only paperwork, but the Pyrphorians cannot operate if Empire owns Prosperity again.</Text>
  <Text ID="267271">Isabel was true to her word in the end. You have to admire her shrewdness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267272">I realise Isabel means well.</Text>
  <Text ID="267273">If Aarhant were here, I'm sure he'd have some good advice.</Text>
  <Text ID="267274">To forge father's signature! Edvard must have been possessed!</Text>
  <Text ID="267275">I would have been right to strike Edvard's cheek, the many times I had inclination!</Text>
  <Text ID="267276">I will not rest until Edvard sees justice, even if I must escort him to the gallows myself!</Text>
  <Text ID="267277">As Edvard is paraded to the town square, I want to be there in the front row.</Text>
  <Text ID="267504">Edvard was the cause of all our grief! To see his face when he discovers we know!</Text>
  <Text ID="267519">We confront Edvard this instant! I have so very many words for him!</Text>
  <Text ID="267520">Cast-iron will make it very difficult for him to sidle away!</Text>
  <Text ID="267521">I will indulge not one of the thousand apologies I presume he has ready.</Text>
  <Text ID="267522">We should do what we can to get the evidence in order. No need to engage with Edvard.</Text>
  <Text ID="267523">The Queen wants the trial to be an occasion. We better make sure we're ready.</Text>
  <Text ID="267524">The evidence at such a high-profile inquiry must be absolutely watertight.</Text>
  <Text ID="267525">Finally we can have our revenge on Edvard for all he has done.</Text>
  <Text ID="267526">Leave no stone unturned. Who knows if Edvard has kept back other nasty surprises for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267527">Now we are ready for Her Majesty. All the eyes of the world will be upon us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267528">If the Queen wants to make a big song and dance of the trial, we better see to it.</Text>
  <Text ID="267529">The Queen's visit, not the trial, may be the greatest occasion of your people's lives.</Text>
  <Text ID="267530">I don't know what I would do without you, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="267531">Everything comes under scrutiny in the presence of royalty.</Text>
  <Text ID="267532">Edvard is as good as dead to me. </Text>
  <Text ID="267533">I will not look at him at the trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267534">Concentrate on securing a verdict for Edvard!</Text>
  <Text ID="267535">You were out there in paradise, and I dragged you into all this. I'm sorry.</Text>
  <Text ID="267536">You are the one positive in all of this. No sister could have asked for more. </Text>
  <Text ID="267537">Is this business really nearly over, eldest? I don't feel any better for all we've dug up.</Text>
  <Text ID="267538">I should have seen through it. Saved father while I had the chance.</Text>
  <Text ID="267674">You cannot allow Bright Sands to be subjugated! Our childhood home!</Text>
  <Text ID="267695">Bright Sands! You must save them!</Text>
  <Text ID="267696">Uncle Edvard… He suffered enough eldest. I believe I can forgive him now.</Text>
  <Text ID="267697">Now we are all that remains, eldest. I intend to take strength from that.</Text>
  <Text ID="267698">We will not give in to terror! Never!</Text>
  <Text ID="267699">We must avenge Edvard— father,  the only way we can.</Text>
  <Text ID="267700">Come what may, I am not afraid.</Text>
  <Text ID="267701">There is only one way left, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="267702">What you did goes far beyond us, dear blood. You have saved us all from a reign of terror.</Text>
  <Text ID="267703">It shall be a proper funeral. Let us reunite the two brothers, side-by-side. Once and for all, confine the past to the past.</Text>
  <Text ID="267704">We must bury them both together in the family tomb.</Text>
  <Text ID="267705">Let us talk once Samuel and Edvard have taken their rightful place side-by-side.</Text>
  <Text ID="267706">I do not feel any more sadness, eldest. The clouds have lifted— azure skies lie beyond.</Text>
  <Text ID="267707">Have joy in your heart, as you make these final arrangements.</Text>
  <Text ID="267708">They will not have Bright Sands!</Text>
  <Text ID="267709">Another glimmer! Isabel fights beside us. </Text>
  <Text ID="267710">They will not stop you, eldest. Lead us forth!</Text>
  <Text ID="267711">Fire rages everywhere! We must unmask these arsonists before its too late!</Text>
  <Text ID="267712">The arsonists must be intercepted!</Text>
  <Text ID="267725">There will be nothing left of the city if the arsonists remain on the prowl!</Text>
  <Text ID="267713">Now the fires are out of control, and the arsonists still loose!</Text>
  <Text ID="267714">Quickly, the civilians! I won't see them swept up in the fighting!</Text>
  <Text ID="267715">Bright Sands is no place for civilians! We must come to their rescue!</Text>
  <Text ID="267716">Find a way to extract them unnoticed!</Text>
  <Text ID="267717">Poor poor Edvard!</Text>
  <Text ID="267718">Edvard was ready to make peace with himself at the end.</Text>
  <Text ID="267719">Father always wanted you to have Bright Sands. The past cannot hold you any more.</Text>
  <Text ID="267720">Edvard died far better than he lived. He is forgiven.</Text>
  <Text ID="267721">If father had but held Edvard— shown his affection. </Text>
  <Text ID="267722">When I come here, I bring only cattails— for peace and prosperity.</Text>
  <Text ID="267723">These stones are not cold, but warm. The sun is shining again.</Text>
  <Text ID="267724">The past is buried but not forgotten.</Text>
  <Text ID="257903">Ready to secretly follow them?</Text>
  <Text ID="258067">Here's a thing, eldest. Please be punctual.</Text>
  <Text ID="258068">Most people would jump at this chance.</Text>
  <Text ID="258069">It would be a compelling task for anyone. </Text>
  <Text ID="258070">I wonder if you can find it within yourself—helping your little sister?</Text>
  <Text ID="258071">Of course this business is far too lively for me...</Text>
  <Text ID="258072">I shall attend other errands meanwhile.</Text>
  <Text ID="258073">Don't feel you have to do this as a courtesy to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="258074">I shall await you by cheerily sifting through paper.</Text>
  <Text ID="258075">I always appreciate your help, however overdue.</Text>
  <Text ID="258076">Rare for promises to be kept, thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258077">You restore a grain of my trust in humanity, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="258078">I'm not going to say I didn't think it possible.</Text>
  <Text ID="258079">Eldest, you outdo yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="258080">Given up? That is the luxury of inconstancy.</Text>
  <Text ID="258081">As you wish, after all I managed without you before.</Text>
  <Text ID="258085">I'm sure you did your utmost.</Text>
  <Text ID="258086">I doubt there is anything more you could have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="258087">It's alright, I didn't expect it would go very well.</Text>
  <Text ID="258088">I dream of some kind of news.</Text>
  <Text ID="258089">I can ask, but after that it is up to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258090">Am I to understand my petition goes unheard?</Text>
  <Text ID="258091">Every duty you fulfil will help build others' trust in you. </Text>
  <Text ID="258092">Why, not one, but several prospects in quick succession!</Text>
  <Text ID="258093">Another appointment, when will the excitement end!?</Text>
  <Text ID="258094">Eldest, if you have any heart at all...I am your kith and kin.</Text>
  <Text ID="258095">Could you really have it on your conscience?</Text>
  <Text ID="258096">Dare I believe it is good news you bring?</Text>
  <Text ID="258097">Tidings, fair or foul?</Text>
  <Text ID="258098">Speak to me, I am ready for the worst.</Text>
  <Text ID="258099">Nothing but paperwork to be done...</Text>
  <Text ID="258100">There's no work for you...</Text>
  <Text ID="258101">Nothing new on the horizon...</Text>
  <Text ID="260048">I am somewhat heartened.</Text>
  <Text ID="260059">I am more hopeful than I was.</Text>
  <Text ID="260060">All seems well for now.</Text>
  <Text ID="260061">Signs are more encouraging.</Text>
  <Text ID="260062">Times must be good.</Text>
  <Text ID="260063">I shouldn't complain at times like these.</Text>
  <Text ID="260064">All quite bearable.</Text>
  <Text ID="260075">I'm happy for you, really I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="260076">You might feel rather pleased with yourself.</Text>
  <Text ID="260077">You've kept things in good order.</Text>
  <Text ID="260078">No-one can begrudge your achievements.</Text>
  <Text ID="260079">You have not been unsuccessful!</Text>
  <Text ID="260080">Your dedication is commendable.</Text>
  <Text ID="260081">You work with reassuring method, eldest.</Text>
  <Text ID="260082">This grim monotony is worse than life.</Text>
  <Text ID="260083">I should like to be someone else.</Text>
  <Text ID="260084">Sigh...</Text>
  <Text ID="260085">I find this all so trivial.</Text>
  <Text ID="260086">How dull.</Text>
  <Text ID="260087">I want to feel something, just not irritable!</Text>
  <Text ID="260088">I'm tired of being tired.</Text>
  <Text ID="260089">You give me no comfort at present.</Text>
  <Text ID="260090">I worried you might be this sort of person.</Text>
  <Text ID="260091">You forget yourself sibling.</Text>
  <Text ID="260092">A quaint interpretation of precision, sibling.</Text>
  <Text ID="260093">When you overlook minutiaie, things go awry.</Text>
  <Text ID="260094">And it's all the harder when one is alone!</Text>
  <Text ID="260095">It's a disordered tangle of briar, sibling. </Text>
  <Text ID="258149">Then you are the long lost sibling. Hallo. I hope we can come to know one another a little. </Text>
  <Text ID="258150">I never thought I'd see you again, sibling. I hope your return coincides with better times.</Text>
  <Text ID="258151">Hallo dear relation.</Text>
  <Text ID="258152">You've returned.</Text>
  <Text ID="258153">I've been holding fort, as ever.</Text>
  <Text ID="258154">Father was given to inquiry. </Text>
  <Text ID="258156">You seem to come and go as you please.</Text>
  <Text ID="258155">I did wonder if you'd come by.</Text>
  <Text ID="258157">Nothing new here, I'm afraid. </Text>
  <Text ID="260232">Perhaps a change of fortunes.</Text>
  <Text ID="260233">Well, I shan't be an ingrate.</Text>
  <Text ID="260234">A thank you is probably in order.</Text>
  <Text ID="260235">Oh what does it matter either way...</Text>
  <Text ID="260236">What else can I do but accept...</Text>
  <Text ID="260237">Then it shall be so...</Text>
  <Text ID="261112">If only I had the invitingly empty sort of paper for writing, not lined, for accounting.</Text>
  <Text ID="261113">Fictions only remind me how little of my own writing I've done lately.</Text>
  <Text ID="261114">If ever I seem far away, remember so were you, those long years.</Text>
  <Text ID="261115">One should get to know one's kin, shouldn't one?</Text>
  <Text ID="261116">Getting things done bright and early maintains discipline for the remaining day.</Text>
  <Text ID="261117">After a jam scone at teatime, I feel a different person. That is to say, a sympathetic one.</Text>
  <Text ID="261118">I can't see how any woman finds calisthenics remotely emancipating.</Text>
  <Text ID="261119">I have to make do with living vicariously through your exploits.</Text>
  <Text ID="260238">No indeed!</Text>
  <Text ID="260239">I can't let it happen.</Text>
  <Text ID="260240">Really this is too much.</Text>
  <Text ID="268121">I have discovered some inefficiencies we ought to address...</Text>
  <Text ID="268122">Our business is being adversely affected by urgent matters we ought to resolve...</Text>
  <Text ID="268123">Here is a matter of the utmost importance we must knock on the head!</Text>
  <Text ID="268124">There is a defect in the economic machine that you ought to correct...</Text>
  <Text ID="268125">A concern has raised its ugly head, that I don't think can wait...</Text>
  <Text ID="268131">Oh this is terrible! We have to save the situation in any way we can!</Text>
  <Text ID="268095">Every settlement needs a market. The people want a place for supplies, provide it!</Text>
  <Text ID="268096">I checked the manifests. Not all our facilities are able to deliver the goods they produce. Please correct the situation!</Text>
  <Text ID="268098">Our settlement is rather small. You will have to attract more farmers if you want to make progress.</Text>
  <Text ID="268101">The farmers are hungry. You'll have to supply them with the necessary, starting with fish.</Text>
  <Text ID="268102">Everything you've built so far consumed wood. We'll be needing more of it to continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="268103">I've been going over the accounts. There is no denying it, we're close to bankruptcy! Avert this disaster!</Text>
  <Text ID="268105">The land can only be farmed if there are enough fields. We must plant them!</Text>
  <Text ID="268106">Work is going unfinished. We must ensure we have sufficient workforce to finish it!</Text>
  <Text ID="268107">We are missing a vital good that cannot be produced on our island. You will have to find a way to import it!</Text>
  <Text ID="268108">You have prepared everything. Now is the time to advance by settling the first workers!</Text>
  <Text ID="268110">Without electricity some facilities won't run. You have to set up the preliminaries to get them going!</Text>
  <Text ID="268119">Our docks are primed for a first ship launch! Everyone waits on your signal!</Text>
  <Text ID="268120">Our city is noteworthy enough to attract its first visitors. We must be sure to make all the necessary arrangements!</Text>
  <Text ID="268093">Numbers, accounts, indices. What might otherwise be a worry to you are my affairs. I'll stay close by in case you should need support.</Text>
  <Text ID="266616">Since that day you saved my life, I have presumed I knew you. But now...</Text>
  <Text ID="254662">A thousand letters from your father go unopened, yet one scribble from your sister changes everything? I didn't even know you had a sister!</Text>
  <Text ID="266665">We are broke, old pal! We can’t afford a passage back to the old world, back to your family! Not unless you’ve suddenly remembered what work is.</Text>
  <Text ID="254663">So this is it. We're leaving paradise behind. You never talked much about family and the like, but you’re dead serious about this, aren’t you? No matter, I made a vow to defend you. And I don't break an oath, even if a blind man could see you leap into the deepest pit of dung.</Text>
  <Text ID="253931">All those houses! You never said how wealthy you were. Why were we selling fish and sleeping in barns?!</Text>
  <Text ID="253932">Looks like death claimed the wrong brother.</Text>
  <Text ID="253933">Your sister reminds me of you. Must mean new adventures await, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="266721">Now that sounds like good news.</Text>
  <Text ID="266732">Who are all these busybodies? Blowing up rocks can't be that complicated!</Text>
  <Text ID="266733">Ha! My apologies, that was indeed impressive! Is there anything dynamite won't solve, I wonder?</Text>
  <Text ID="266946">Look! Devils from below breathing fire and flame!</Text>
  <Text ID="266947">We are not afraid of cowards hiding behind masks.</Text>
  <Text ID="266948">Their fleet is formidable. I count many ships.</Text>
  <Text ID="267006">Yes, just look at her. I bet she already forgot who we are.</Text>
  <Text ID="267007">They are at peace now.</Text>
  <Text ID="267008">...the Queen. She's the Queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="267009">After all we've been through?</Text>
  <Text ID="267142">Liar! You are the picture of regret!</Text>
  <Text ID="267143">You don't understand pain. Real pain.</Text>
  <Text ID="267150">We're nearing the place your father died. Whatever happens, stay calm!</Text>
  <Text ID="267151">We didn't come here to be insulted, we came to strike a bargain. The demolitions man Thomas, we want him.</Text>
  <Text ID="264982">It's been a long hard day. The people need to rest. And maybe wet their whistles. </Text>
  <Text ID="266524">A cloud still hangs over this place, please make it go away!</Text>
  <Text ID="266525">She has you doing all those chores you tried to leave behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="266526">Everything pivots on this enterprise for your sister, I won't watch you let her down.</Text>
  <Text ID="266527">You're better with humankind than I used to believe.</Text>
  <Text ID="266528">First the weather, now the people!</Text>
  <Text ID="266529">It is not rain but wet mist! And endless! What are we doing here?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266530">Disrespectful chatter abounds about your father, and how he died.</Text>
  <Text ID="266531">Sometimes feels like your sister hardly knows you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266532">The tin rush left this island ugly. </Text>
  <Text ID="266533">Funny to watch you get your hands dirty.</Text>
  <Text ID="266534">So serious all of a sudden. Where’s that old spirit of yours gone?</Text>
  <Text ID="265004">He certainly knows how to silence his critics. </Text>
  <Text ID="265005">A letter, it bears Edvard’s Seal!</Text>
  <Text ID="265056">Open the letter, he's clearly up to no good!</Text>
  <Text ID="266606">Though the burden is lifted, Edvard will keep you headlocked for life if you allow him to.</Text>
  <Text ID="266607">Edvard has shown his weakness as a leader, we must exploit it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266608">This is our chance to show Edvard who rules the waves.</Text>
  <Text ID="266609">Sometimes doing the wrong thing, is the right thing, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="266610">Why would we need a licence to build a boat? Seems that's how it is here...</Text>
  <Text ID="266611">Once this shipyard is built, we can gesture rudely at Edvard, and go back to adventuring.</Text>
  <Text ID="266612">She says it's "your" shipyard? Does this mean we're going to be here forever?</Text>
  <Text ID="266613">All I smell on your Uncle is greed.</Text>
  <Text ID="266614">Don’t grovel for your Uncle. He has no power over you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266615">You do know Edvard has no intention of lifting that debt?</Text>
  <Text ID="266203">Still have a few sticks of dynamite! We can blow our way through!</Text>
  <Text ID="266208">Mr. Ticker has opened my eyes to the world of controlled destruction!</Text>
  <Text ID="266209">Perhaps not refined enough for your sister, but at least your workers can start their dig. </Text>
  <Text ID="266781">Always dangerous, getting wrapped-up in the business of a Queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="266795">My bond is to you, not to your monarch.</Text>
  <Text ID="266796">You're part of it now, just like your father was.</Text>
  <Text ID="266797">Once you reach the top there's only one way from there.</Text>
  <Text ID="266798">I'm still waiting for the boom!</Text>
  <Text ID="266799">I suppose it is better to let the experts handle it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266800">My sword is fashioned from Ukku steel, but to produce in these quantities!</Text>
  <Text ID="266801">This steel will command great value.</Text>
  <Text ID="266802">I never imagined a city could grow so fast.</Text>
  <Text ID="266803">You're a real fat cat now! Hope you remember one day how you got here…</Text>
  <Text ID="266804">The workers may as well start preparing for the detonation.</Text>
  <Text ID="266805">Admit it, you’d never have hired a demolition expert in the old days.</Text>
  <Text ID="266806">Fizzle, fizzle, boom! Hahaha.</Text>
  <Text ID="266807">The way to the iron mines is clear!</Text>
  <Text ID="266808">Perhaps you can help me understand who keeps a murder under their hat? Forgive me, I know we speak of your father…</Text>
  <Text ID="266216">The foul scent of a killer. We cannot let him escape.</Text>
  <Text ID="266217">Someone supplies the murderer from Madame Kahina's harbour? We should investigate.</Text>
  <Text ID="266228">The locals say that trading ship over there belongs to a stranger. Maybe that's the supplier!</Text>
  <Text ID="266240">He freely admits to his crime! Get him!</Text>
  <Text ID="266241">No, he is dead! It cannot end here, we have no answers!</Text>
  <Text ID="266248">There must be some clue among the wreckage, anything!</Text>
  <Text ID="266249">It's empty!</Text>
  <Text ID="266250">Endless cloaks and masks!</Text>
  <Text ID="266251">Maggot-ridden!</Text>
  <Text ID="266252">An assortment to make the blood curdle!</Text>
  <Text ID="266899">A tiger must stay low and close to his prey.</Text>
  <Text ID="266914">Still your rage. The trail may not end here. </Text>
  <Text ID="266915">There, that must be the villain's ship!</Text>
  <Text ID="266916">Keep a good distance, but don't let the wretch slip away.</Text>
  <Text ID="266917">Your father's testament is clear! No guilty man would write with such confidence!</Text>
  <Text ID="266918">He has nowhere to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="266919">There is the ship. Let's keep our distance, see where it goes.</Text>
  <Text ID="266920">His words are a warning. Whoever our nemesis is, they are many steps ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="266921">He is dead.</Text>
  <Text ID="267206">I can't believe you left me to look ater shop.</Text>
  <Text ID="267211">This is not what I was born to do.</Text>
  <Text ID="267212">Our bond is being seriously tested. What are all these papers?</Text>
  <Text ID="267213">Admit it, you've forgotten about me.</Text>
  <Text ID="267214">How did Hannah do this all those years? I'm beginning to feel her pain.</Text>
  <Text ID="267215">I've got people asking me which palette of what needs to go where!</Text>
  <Text ID="267458">If you'd taken me with you, I could have helped!</Text>
  <Text ID="267464">I hear you ducked out of a war. Not for the first time, eh, old pal?</Text>
  <Text ID="267465">Now is no time for boldness, but caution.</Text>
  <Text ID="267466">Don't distract me, old pal. I'm getting better at accounting!</Text>
  <Text ID="267467">Edvard! I told you he was rotten as a fig.</Text>
  <Text ID="267468">Edvard is behind this? He's pathetic.</Text>
  <Text ID="267469">There's a space between revenge and forgiveness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267539">Your ill tidings come as no surprise to me. Edvard's face betrays the game is up.</Text>
  <Text ID="267546">I pity the man.</Text>
  <Text ID="267547">There will be punishment. But Edvard has suffered from the day Samuel died.</Text>
  <Text ID="267548">Whatever the punishment, the damage to Edvard is already done.</Text>
  <Text ID="267549">We must prepare for a reckoning. Edvard was never the true enemy.</Text>
  <Text ID="267550"> It is the Pyrphorians behind all of this, we cannot neglect the threat they pose.</Text>
  <Text ID="267551">The trial is a distraction. The real danger we are yet to face.</Text>
  <Text ID="267552">It is a start. But the Pyphorians are many.</Text>
  <Text ID="267553">Do everything to make sure the Queen is safe, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="267554">It will be an honour to have the Queen here, but not without risk.</Text>
  <Text ID="267555">Good but the Queen may still be vulnerable.</Text>
  <Text ID="267556">Stay attuned. This is the perfect time for our enemy to recover.</Text>
  <Text ID="267557">We have seen nothing of the Pyrphorian order but their minions so far.</Text>
  <Text ID="267558">Whoever is behind the Pyrphorians will take this time to weigh their options.</Text>
  <Text ID="267559">We cannot let this business with Edvard divert us from the real threat.</Text>
  <Text ID="267560">Black clouds loom my old friend, be ready to raise your umbrella. </Text>
  <Text ID="267561">I feel uneasy, and it's not the trial.</Text>
  <Text ID="267562">Even if we cannot forgive Edvard, we have to learn to let it go.</Text>
  <Text ID="267563">I have met the jury. They are idiots!</Text>
  <Text ID="267564">The Queen certainly speaks her mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="267727">The Pyrphorians have seized Bright Sands. They enchain it to their foul cause!</Text>
  <Text ID="267747">The skies above Bright Sands glow with maleficence!</Text>
  <Text ID="267748">It is time, old pal. Our nemesis approaches!</Text>
  <Text ID="267749">It is time we stamped this fire for good.</Text>
  <Text ID="267750">When they see how bright you burn old pal, they will shrivel.</Text>
  <Text ID="267751">The first of many victories!</Text>
  <Text ID="267752">You have my blade. I am ready. </Text>
  <Text ID="267753">Old friend, it's over! The last Pyrphorians are sunk!</Text>
  <Text ID="267754">Before all this began, I owed you a debt. I may have paid it now, but I've made up my mind to stay old pal, help you grow, at least a little longer.   </Text>
  <Text ID="266382">Dynamite fishing?! You're serious? Well, the village north is always short on food.</Text>
  <Text ID="266383">Remember when we escaped the pits back when? Still some dynamite left.</Text>
  <Text ID="266384">I hid it next to the abandoned lighthouse. Come and fetch it!</Text>
  <Text ID="266385">Here it is! Just get plenty of distance on the throw.</Text>
  <Text ID="266386">The dynamite is at the lighthouse, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="266387">They're not expecting Queen Parrotfish; anything with fins will do.</Text>
  <Text ID="266388">All the blistered fish they could ever want.</Text>
  <Text ID="266389">A long sea journey won't make me give up my vow to stick by you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266390">I owe my life to you. You go, I follow, until I decide that debt is paid.</Text>
  <Text ID="266391">If you've never told me you had a  sister, what else haven't you told me about?</Text>
  <Text ID="266392">Sometimes you have to face the past to have a future. </Text>
  <Text ID="266393">A bird with a spear would be faster.</Text>
  <Text ID="266394">You’re just destroying coral, you clown.</Text>
  <Text ID="266395">You couldn’t hit an cow’s arse with a sitar.</Text>
  <Text ID="266396">Even more roasted fish!</Text>
  <Text ID="266397">Still trying to get used to that smell of char.</Text>
  <Text ID="266398">You do have an eye for opportunity. After all, it’s not TNT the locals are short of.</Text>
  <Text ID="266399">Are we leaving on a packet ship, or has the wind blown through your ears again?</Text>
  <Text ID="266400">If it's you lighting the fuse, I'm going to keep well back.</Text>
  <Text ID="266401">Must be plenty of fish in this bay.</Text>
  <Text ID="266402">Don't look at me— dynamite was your idea.</Text>
  <Text ID="258102">Disturb an Immortal?!</Text>
  <Text ID="258103">I decide when my vigil ends.</Text>
  <Text ID="258104">This better be a call to adventure.</Text>
  <Text ID="258105">Ready if you are.</Text>
  <Text ID="258106">Sat sri akaal, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="258107">Good to see you, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="258108">My sword is always ready.</Text>
  <Text ID="260151">Purge the filth of ego inside yourself!</Text>
  <Text ID="260152">You are that carefree? </Text>
  <Text ID="260153">Want to be a hero? Try being a human first.</Text>
  <Text ID="260154">Get a grip on your destiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="260155">I know you. This isn't you.</Text>
  <Text ID="260156">If you seek heaven, you have far to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="260157">If you go down, I'll go down with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="260158">I'd rather be stuck at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="260159">Monsoons of bad feeling!</Text>
  <Text ID="260160">Dreadful. </Text>
  <Text ID="260161">God hates us.</Text>
  <Text ID="260162">Miserable.</Text>
  <Text ID="260163">No-one deserves this.</Text>
  <Text ID="260164">Why are we even here?</Text>
  <Text ID="260165">For once you have my respect, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="260166">You've come a long way.</Text>
  <Text ID="260167">You bust the world open like ripe fruit.</Text>
  <Text ID="260168">Good fire-breather! Thaw this frozen wasteland.</Text>
  <Text ID="260169">Conquer your mind, conquer the world.</Text>
  <Text ID="260170">You do your family honour.</Text>
  <Text ID="260171">Milk the willing cow!</Text>
  <Text ID="260172">Sweet nectar.</Text>
  <Text ID="260173">Cascades of good feeling.</Text>
  <Text ID="260174">We are blessed.</Text>
  <Text ID="260175">No sun, but somehow all rosy.</Text>
  <Text ID="260176">Better than being at sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="260177">God loves us.</Text>
  <Text ID="260178">Perfection is close.</Text>
  <Text ID="260179">Ah old pal, it's been a while since we adventured together.</Text>
  <Text ID="260180">I've been waiting for your call old pal, wherever you go I will follow.</Text>
  <Text ID="260241">Thank the high one.</Text>
  <Text ID="260242">This is a blessing.</Text>
  <Text ID="260243">Divine succour!</Text>
  <Text ID="260247">Hush your mouth!</Text>
  <Text ID="260248">Why should I!?</Text>
  <Text ID="260249">I will not!</Text>
  <Text ID="260244">Of course.</Text>
  <Text ID="260245">Odd but good. </Text>
  <Text ID="260246">Curious. I accept.</Text>
  <Text ID="261120">The land of many rivers shall see me again, when all is forgiven.</Text>
  <Text ID="261121">Old pal, you don't find it strange they keep the recipe for sausage so secret?! </Text>
  <Text ID="261122">If the body is the field in which the mind works, would you farm on barren soil?</Text>
  <Text ID="261123">Do not incite violence. Prepare for it.</Text>
  <Text ID="261124">The music here is fine, but it lacks the colour of a raga.</Text>
  <Text ID="261125">I vowed to defend you, it requires no explanation.</Text>
  <Text ID="261126">Compared to what brought us together, this is nothing old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="261127">We met in war; we will find ourselves there again. We must be prepared for that moment.</Text>
  <Text ID="265436">I never renounced my faith I'm just taking a pause.</Text>
  <Text ID="258117">A pot of gold for the milk of a lioness.</Text>
  <Text ID="258127">Our bond runs two ways, does it not?</Text>
  <Text ID="258128">Adventure, old pal?</Text>
  <Text ID="258129">Here's a chance to let off some steam.</Text>
  <Text ID="258130">In the old days we'd have done this in our sleep.</Text>
  <Text ID="258118">Fair winds, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="258131">When we begin, we arrive.</Text>
  <Text ID="258132">I owe you one.</Text>
  <Text ID="258119">You honour this Immortal.</Text>
  <Text ID="258133">You make molehills of mountains!</Text>
  <Text ID="258134">Once again, I am indebted to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258135">Just like old times.</Text>
  <Text ID="258136">See how the whole world bows before us! </Text>
  <Text ID="258120">Might sparring bring your focus back? </Text>
  <Text ID="258137">Don't blame yourself, it was not to be. </Text>
  <Text ID="258138">Lady luck wasn't on our side.</Text>
  <Text ID="258121">If I cannot trust you, who can?</Text>
  <Text ID="258139">Changed your mind? They do say change is all we have.</Text>
  <Text ID="258122">Do I see a happy face?</Text>
  <Text ID="258140">Care to tell me how it went?</Text>
  <Text ID="258141">I sense you have news?</Text>
  <Text ID="258123">Don't expect to succeed sitting on your heels.</Text>
  <Text ID="258142">Back home, it's shameful to have to ask twice.</Text>
  <Text ID="258143">When lost, trust your instincts. </Text>
  <Text ID="258124">I don't know if you should let down your guard just yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="258144">Seems God chose you to do good deeds.</Text>
  <Text ID="258145">You know once you stop, I can't be your friend any more.</Text>
  <Text ID="258125">It's me, old pal!</Text>
  <Text ID="258146">Don't let them lead you astray.</Text>
  <Text ID="258126">Leave it with me for a while.</Text>
  <Text ID="258147">I'm still making inquiries, old pal.</Text>
  <Text ID="258148">I'll be onto something soon, I know it.</Text>
  <Text ID="262229">Are you ready to follow the ship?</Text>
  <Text ID="262230">We must follow them!</Text>
  <Text ID="268126">I've been pondering this problem for a long time, and I feel now is the time to act!</Text>
  <Text ID="268127">This cloud has been looming for some time, we must disperse it!</Text>
  <Text ID="268128">This might not seem a problem now, but it could one day spiral out of control!</Text>
  <Text ID="268129">It is easy to dismiss these things as trivial, but history shows us othewise...</Text>
  <Text ID="268130">You must dispel this illusion, before it becomes real...</Text>
  <Text ID="268132">A terror! How did we not foresee it?! We must act swiftly!</Text>
  <Text ID="268094">I am the good observer, my friend. When there is more than meets the eye, I will let you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="268097">The first step is your most important. Make sure to moor at a shore that provides all the soils we need!</Text>
  <Text ID="268100">People here are too lazy to go across country. Lay a street!</Text>
  <Text ID="268104">People need somewhere to drown their sorrows. A pub will fill this town with laughter!</Text>
  <Text ID="268109">Fear not the new world that awaits. You only have to set sail into the unknown!</Text>
  <Text ID="268111">Bad news! A greedy rival seized the majority of shares on one of your islands. Take back control!</Text>
  <Text ID="268112">War! This is serious! End the violence however you can!</Text>
  <Text ID="268113">We've been climbers, but our power of influence has now worn out. We have to recover some of our leverage.</Text>
  <Text ID="268114">Study your texts! Going through your notes once in a while might be quite helpful.</Text>
  <Text ID="268115">So you started making plans, measuring the land. Good. Come back to it once you have everything set!</Text>
  <Text ID="268116">When I look into your people's faces I see trouble. Make sure their misery doesn't become a problem!</Text>
  <Text ID="268117">Your people oppose you! Find a way to solve this dangerous predicament soon!</Text>
  <Text ID="268118">Flames surge everywhere! Fight this inferno fast!</Text>
  <Text ID="253934">Where have you been? Without you brats we’ll never be done with this obligation!</Text>
  <Text ID="253935">Nobody likes a traitor, let alone his tainted offspring. Better make yourself scarce.</Text>
  <Text ID="266717">What? Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to abducting my workers? The Queen’s ambassador himself shall hear of this.</Text>
  <Text ID="266727">Pencil-polishing popinjay! I should have been rid of you long ago!</Text>
  <Text ID="266728">The real tragedy here is the vast funeral bill that goes unpaid, while this brat is living the life of O'Reilly!</Text>
  <Text ID="266943">No, child. It's too late. Judgement has already come.</Text>
  <Text ID="266944">I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="266945">No please, don't be afraid. It's time to let go. My ship has sailed...</Text>
  <Text ID="267035">What are you talking about, child? Only a talk between brothers, that's all.</Text>
  <Text ID="267036">From the moment I saw you, I knew it meant trouble.</Text>
  <Text ID="267037">I knew this would happen. I was just saying to your father, I'll never come up to him— not even having sacrificed it all.</Text>
  <Text ID="267038">He never understood the pain, of my life in his shadow.</Text>
  <Text ID="267039">I can't be scared. No more than I am already.</Text>
  <Text ID="267040">The Pyrphorians are pure evil. I thought I had control of this frightful arrangement, but when they murdered Samuel, I realised a day would come that they came for me too. The day they purge this decaying Empire with fire and flame.</Text>
  <Text ID="267041">Lo and behold, Her Majesty! Finally, I became worthy of her notice.</Text>
  <Text ID="267042">Yes. Guilty as charged.</Text>
  <Text ID="261202">Were you expecting celebrations and a fatted calf on your return?</Text>
  <Text ID="262228">I think it was probably your absence in the end that did for your father.</Text>
  <Text ID="264983">What, still here? Establishing a rival company? On that dishevelled island?!</Text>
  <Text ID="264984">Do you remain here out of spite, or is this some futile attempt at competition?</Text>
  <Text ID="266535">You'll not have a dribble of inheritance after all your frivolity out in god-knows-where.</Text>
  <Text ID="266536">Prosperity's sale is a disaster for the Empire, the Queen has said as much to me herself!</Text>
  <Text ID="266537">Prosperity, sold to South American rebels, can you imagine?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266538">Had you expected a fatted calf to be slit upon your return?</Text>
  <Text ID="266539">You must now see, no-one wants you here.</Text>
  <Text ID="265007">As you are so desperate to appear responsible, you’ll be pleased to hear the cost of that fantastical funeral falls to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="265008">Your worthless rags have barely covered anything. Now bring me sails— It's not like you have any use for them!</Text>
  <Text ID="265009">Repay me now, or sell up!</Text>
  <Text ID="265010">Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, four bags full.</Text>
  <Text ID="265011">Good kid. Go on now, I'll let you know when I think of the next thing.</Text>
  <Text ID="265012">Don’t think you're finished, brat.</Text>
  <Text ID="265023">Feels an eternity since the funeral— and the cost! Why it was extortionate!</Text>
  <Text ID="265024">I loathe the reek of lanolin, but if farmers smocks are all you have... </Text>
  <Text ID="265064">Where are my sails!?</Text>
  <Text ID="265019">Haven't seen a prison transport of mine, have you? If you do, be sure to return any salvage to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="265021">Don't even think about sheltering Samuel’s co-conspirators! Deliver them to prison at once, and I might lift your debt. </Text>
  <Text ID="265022">You have seen sense then. I suppose I shall have to inform Sir Archibald that your obligations are met. </Text>
  <Text ID="265025">That was none of your business! And what right has the crown to meddle in my accounts? What right?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266745">How long can it take to peel a potato?</Text>
  <Text ID="266746">Where is my sausage!?</Text>
  <Text ID="266747">Are you darning the things yourself? </Text>
  <Text ID="266748">The longer you wait, the less inclined I shall be to writing off your sizeable debt. </Text>
  <Text ID="266749">A few bottles of bathtub booze? </Text>
  <Text ID="266750">Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to theft?</Text>
  <Text ID="266830">Murdered? You are joking, surely!</Text>
  <Text ID="267216">What are you up to overseas?</Text>
  <Text ID="267229">When will you give up pursuing the past and look to your future as my charge?</Text>
  <Text ID="267230">Gallivanting off again? People will call you irresponsible!</Text>
  <Text ID="267231">Sir Archibald sent you, did he?</Text>
  <Text ID="267232"> You worked so hard to defy me! Then you run away again!</Text>
  <Text ID="267233">Have you met with any difficulty out there?</Text>
  <Text ID="267234">I promise not to ask any more of you, if you were to spend more time here.</Text>
  <Text ID="267470">You don't know what you do.</Text>
  <Text ID="267477">That island was signed off in Samuel's name!</Text>
  <Text ID="267478">Do not speak to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="267565">Forget me, my race is run. There is a true devil is loose. It must be vanquished. </Text>
  <Text ID="267568">My defeat can still be your victory.</Text>
  <Text ID="267569">I know you want a villain, but this plot goes far beyond my petty greed.</Text>
  <Text ID="267570">Then you have all I can give you. I pray that will be enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="267571">I'm sure you wish it was I had died. Well soon you may have your wish.</Text>
  <Text ID="267572">Prosperity - it was only the beginning. These people will destroy eveything, everyone if they have to.</Text>
  <Text ID="267573">There is a great danger to the established order. I will give you any help I can.</Text>
  <Text ID="267574">My life may be forfeit, but I can still do a last bit of good.</Text>
  <Text ID="267575">I didn't know what I was getting into, and then it was too late.</Text>
  <Text ID="267576">My father never loved me, only  Samuel those long years.</Text>
  <Text ID="267577">I sold our family down the river, no use hiding that now.</Text>
  <Text ID="267578">I regret everything. I know what Hannah must think of me.</Text>
  <Text ID="267579">I will not play the martyr, but I am ready to sacrifice myself for you and your sister's happiness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267580">I have been selfish, but I am not one of them, I never was. You must believe me. </Text>
  <Text ID="267581">I did not know they would kill Samuel for it, I had no idea!</Text>
  <Text ID="253788">At least make yourself useful.</Text>
  <Text ID="253820">Lift a finger for your last significant family!</Text>
  <Text ID="253821">Are you just going to stand by?</Text>
  <Text ID="253822">Any chance you'll take responsibility?</Text>
  <Text ID="253823">I'll bet you're too spoiled to do as you're told.</Text>
  <Text ID="253789">I'll believe it when I see it.</Text>
  <Text ID="253824">Thinking of the reward?</Text>
  <Text ID="253825">Quite unprecedented!</Text>
  <Text ID="253790">It shouldn't be about the material reward, but here.</Text>
  <Text ID="253826">Be thankful to the one who gave you such an opportunity.</Text>
  <Text ID="253827">Never say I don't help you.</Text>
  <Text ID="253828">Finally discovered a sense of duty, have we?</Text>
  <Text ID="253829">I suppose you'll want paying now?</Text>
  <Text ID="253792">Betrayal must run in the family!</Text>
  <Text ID="253830">Giving up? Ungrateful brat!</Text>
  <Text ID="253791">I should never have trusted this to a feckless youth!</Text>
  <Text ID="253831">Your father always moaned about you, seems he was right..</Text>
  <Text ID="253832">The sacrifices your family has made, and for this!</Text>
  <Text ID="253793">Hurry, damn you!</Text>
  <Text ID="253833">When will you show your family some gratitude?</Text>
  <Text ID="253834">You will not spoil my plans with your tardiness!</Text>
  <Text ID="253794">Now is not the time for sloping off!</Text>
  <Text ID="253835">There's no getting away from the work to be done.</Text>
  <Text ID="253836">Don't think you're finished there...</Text>
  <Text ID="253795">Would you betray your blood?</Text>
  <Text ID="253837">You don't seem to understand the magnitude of this decision!</Text>
  <Text ID="253796">Ready to repay my charity?</Text>
  <Text ID="253838">Must I hold your hand at every step?</Text>
  <Text ID="253839">Tell me you've managed something?</Text>
  <Text ID="257191">I don't have anything I could trust to you…</Text>
  <Text ID="257192">Come crawling back some other occasion.</Text>
  <Text ID="257193">A watched pot never boils!</Text>
  <Text ID="257194">A family outing.</Text>
  <Text ID="257195">Attend to your Uncle.</Text>
  <Text ID="257196">It's not a plea for companionship.</Text>
  <Text ID="259984">And all because of me.</Text>
  <Text ID="259985">And I was always so overlooked! </Text>
  <Text ID="259986">Not everyone is born for success. </Text>
  <Text ID="259987">They must now see it was I who turned out best.</Text>
  <Text ID="259988">I was always the dutiful child, the good child. </Text>
  <Text ID="259989">Finally, after all I've suffered. </Text>
  <Text ID="259990">Proof I should have been the one chosen. </Text>
  <Text ID="259991">You'll never be special, you know. </Text>
  <Text ID="259992">Heavens, you think this makes you a Goode? </Text>
  <Text ID="259993">Helpful or not, your presence is unwelcome. </Text>
  <Text ID="259994">Nothing you do will lift the cloud.</Text>
  <Text ID="259995">It's the least you could do. </Text>
  <Text ID="259996">Your father would be proud. </Text>
  <Text ID="259997">Perhaps now you'll leave me in peace e'gad.</Text>
  <Text ID="259998">Things never go without a hiccup, do they?!</Text>
  <Text ID="259999">This is folly!</Text>
  <Text ID="260000">Every time I have to play second fiddle! </Text>
  <Text ID="260001">What is the meaning of this!?</Text>
  <Text ID="260002">Why do I deserve to suffer! </Text>
  <Text ID="260003">It was agreed this matter would be settled!</Text>
  <Text ID="260004">I am more than capable of dealing with this! </Text>
  <Text ID="260005">Isn't it obvious? Everything is your fault. </Text>
  <Text ID="260006">Our family should have disowned you long ago.</Text>
  <Text ID="260007">Why couldn't you stay away?</Text>
  <Text ID="260008">This is all your doing.</Text>
  <Text ID="260009">Wastrel.</Text>
  <Text ID="260010">You always were a disappointment. </Text>
  <Text ID="260011">You have no inkling of this business!</Text>
  <Text ID="256858">We can't be seen together.</Text>
  <Text ID="256906">Get away! I wouldn't want to be accused of nepotism.</Text>
  <Text ID="256907">Here to sponge from your Uncle?</Text>
  <Text ID="256908">What is this visitation?</Text>
  <Text ID="256909">Get away, callow apparition of youth!</Text>
  <Text ID="256910">Do not goad me, showing your face here!</Text>
  <Text ID="256911">Why do you persist like some restless spirit?</Text>
  <Text ID="260958">Keep out! None of your business!</Text>
  <Text ID="260959">If your father had only let me in, we could have built this together...</Text>
  <Text ID="260960">This city will be a credit to our family, you'll see. </Text>
  <Text ID="260961">Commerce and industry can haul Goode and Sons back from the grave.</Text>
  <Text ID="260962">I modernised the trade fleet the moment I took control.</Text>
  <Text ID="260963">The sea is in my blood, just as much as it was in your father's. </Text>
  <Text ID="260964">I have routes all planned out, they're perfect! Perfect!</Text>
  <Text ID="260965">Of course I have enough experience handling sailors!</Text>
  <Text ID="260012">Don't expect gratitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="260013">Oh thank heaven.</Text>
  <Text ID="260014">Sweet mercy. </Text>
  <Text ID="260015">See, I'm not afraid to take a calculated risk. </Text>
  <Text ID="260016">Why would there be a problem?</Text>
  <Text ID="260017">Why should I have compunctions about it?</Text>
  <Text ID="261102">I shouldn't have to play second fiddle to anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="261104">Goode &amp; Sons has a future among the constellations, not in petty ship trades!</Text>
  <Text ID="261105">I was born for this age. With my olympian ideas, my industry, my sacrifice, all is possible!</Text>
  <Text ID="261106">Why should his passion and ambition count against a man?</Text>
  <Text ID="261107">The responsibility could weigh heavy, but I am more than equal, much more.</Text>
  <Text ID="261103">I ride my Phaeton more and more often to the palace, I'm in great demand with Queen and council you see.</Text>
  <Text ID="261108">Naturally I deal with Sir Archibald; it's his duty to greet Her Majesty's proudest subjects.</Text>
  <Text ID="261109">Isabel Sarmento? Never heard of her.</Text>
  <Text ID="261110">I'm watching you. Any suspicious behaviour will be reported immediately to Eli.</Text>
  <Text ID="261111">Samuel was always so suspicious of Lady Hunt, but she has a seat on the royal council for goodness' sake!</Text>
  <Text ID="255621">Is trade worth the painful sight that is you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255628">I am the real fire beneath this company.</Text>
  <Text ID="255629">I have the eye for a deal Samuel didn't.</Text>
  <Text ID="255630">I was born for business.</Text>
  <Text ID="255631">Bargains are my destiny.</Text>
  <Text ID="255632">No need to sell my soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="255633">Why must I always deal with the devil?!</Text>
  <Text ID="260018">I have decided otherwise! </Text>
  <Text ID="260019">Don't tell me what to do!</Text>
  <Text ID="260020">There will be no negotiation!</Text>
  <Text ID="256457">I merely choose the pieces, they move of their own accord.</Text>
  <Text ID="256458">I'm old, child! I prefer to see others embrace life.</Text>
  <Text ID="256459">You'd be doing this for the good of all of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="256460">Perhaps you can bear this torch?</Text>
  <Text ID="256461">Patience is the most underestimated of the virtues.</Text>
  <Text ID="256462">I hope you find it illuminating.</Text>
  <Text ID="256463">Good, child.</Text>
  <Text ID="256464">I shall be waiting.</Text>

  <Text ID="256466">As loyal as a puppy!</Text>
  <Text ID="256467">I'm sure you could rule this entire land someday.</Text>
  <Text ID="256468">How remarkable!</Text>
  <Text ID="256469">You must have a good heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="256473">Superstition perhaps?</Text>
  <Text ID="256474">I admire your honesty.</Text>
  <Text ID="256470">I don't always treat grievances so lightly.</Text>
  <Text ID="256471">Don't worry, I won't hold a grudge.</Text>
  <Text ID="256472">Did you hope God might intervene?</Text>
  <Text ID="256479">The older I am, the more patient I become.</Text>
  <Text ID="256480">Be sure to deliver on promises.</Text>
  <Text ID="256481">I don't see you as the discourteous type.</Text>
  <Text ID="256482">There is yet more pollen, little bee.</Text>
  <Text ID="256483">I could use more of that youthful spirit.</Text>
  <Text ID="256484">Hard to get out, once you're in the habit.</Text>
  <Text ID="256485">Choose your side very carefully.</Text>
  <Text ID="256486">Don't be a fool, the pendulum swings with me.</Text>
  <Text ID="256476">Hoping to enlighten me?</Text>
  <Text ID="256477">Come, don't be shy.</Text>
  <Text ID="256478">Is it done?</Text>
  <Text ID="257197">I've nothing for you, at least, not yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="257198">Oh does, your poor heart burn without my guidance?</Text>
  <Text ID="257199">Crawl to me in hope? There is none.</Text>
  <Text ID="257200">I have been without company for so long…</Text>
  <Text ID="257201">Lead me youth, into the expanse.</Text>
  <Text ID="257202">I need a ghost ship.</Text>
  <Text ID="258382">It feels as if we've met before, or perhaps even, that we're quite well-acquainted.</Text>
  <Text ID="258383">I've been looking forward to this for a long, long time. </Text>
  <Text ID="258384">You've nothing to fear from me, and I'm sure I shall have nothing to fear from you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258385">Everything progresses as expected. </Text>
  <Text ID="258386">Balance will be restored. </Text>
  <Text ID="258387">I am soothed. </Text>
  <Text ID="258388">Patience rewards us.</Text>
  <Text ID="258389">Soon there can be peace. </Text>
  <Text ID="258390">I am quite tranquil. </Text>
  <Text ID="258391">What a pleasing development.</Text>
  <Text ID="258392">What an independent mind you have. </Text>
  <Text ID="258393">My young friend, you have done well.</Text>
  <Text ID="258394">Aren't you are a sympathetic soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="258395">We all want you to succeed. </Text>
  <Text ID="258396">Good ideas deserve respect.</Text>
  <Text ID="258397">The Empire needs a symbol like you.</Text>
  <Text ID="258398">Such an open mind! </Text>
  <Text ID="258399">I shall not waver. </Text>
  <Text ID="258400">As always, I endure.</Text>
  <Text ID="258401">I remain unpeturbed.</Text>
  <Text ID="258402">I have always been a stoic. </Text>
  <Text ID="258403">We continue as planned. </Text>
  <Text ID="258404">I have already recovered. </Text>
  <Text ID="258405">I have thick skin. </Text>
  <Text ID="258406">You are not ready. </Text>
  <Text ID="258407">You show weakness.</Text>
  <Text ID="258408">Poor lost lamb.</Text>
  <Text ID="258409">You think that is goodness?! </Text>
  <Text ID="258410">One small mistake can mean the end. </Text>
  <Text ID="258411">Such a pity you do not learn. </Text>
  <Text ID="258412">You don't have the steel!</Text>
  <Text ID="255392">Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow. I hope you're not expecting me to go easy on you?</Text>
  <Text ID="255393">Here to hunt me down? My spirit is already free, you can never pin me down.</Text>
  <Text ID="256851">I look forward to our little meetings.</Text>
  <Text ID="256859">How nice of you to visit.</Text>
  <Text ID="256860">Relax, everything will be taken care of.</Text>
  <Text ID="256861">Appearance is everything, as you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="256862">Posture and bearing tell all.</Text>
  <Text ID="256863">You see, I have nothing to hide.</Text>
  <Text ID="256864">A great pleasure that you come me for advice.</Text>
  <Text ID="260898">Sacrifices must be made for us to have harmony here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260899">Call me old-fashioned, but I like to keep order. </Text>
  <Text ID="260900">Everything in its right place, and to everything its due.</Text>
  <Text ID="260901">I am a fossil, I won't pretend to understand modern ways.</Text>
  <Text ID="260902">My fleet are as unswerving as I, in their obligations.</Text>
  <Text ID="260903">I have ships in many harbours.</Text>
  <Text ID="260904">Humble trade ships, nothing more. </Text>
  <Text ID="260905">The face that launched a thousand ships.</Text>
  <Text ID="258413">Bravo, a show of faith.</Text>
  <Text ID="258414">Why, indeed!</Text>
  <Text ID="258415">One must learn to be thankful.</Text>
  <Text ID="258416">How very appropriate.</Text>
  <Text ID="258417">Yes.</Text>
  <Text ID="258418">Good.</Text>
  <Text ID="260983">'I've recently discovered hypnosis— works wonders on the sleepless.</Text>

  <Text ID="260986">I retired from the spotlight when I remarried. But being part of the royal council is a pleasing distraction.</Text>
  <Text ID="260987">Though I've been a Hunt a long time, it's as my dead brother used to say; once a Harlow, always a Harlow.</Text>

  <Text ID="258427">Fragrant baskets of shiny red apples.</Text>
  <Text ID="258428">Very well, if you will no longer be tempted. </Text>
  <Text ID="258429">Our contract was not binding. </Text>

  <Text ID="256297">How thoughtful.</Text>
  <Text ID="256298">Chivalry is not dead yet. </Text>
  <Text ID="256299">Treated like royalty.</Text>
  <Text ID="256300">I'm touched. </Text>
  <Text ID="256301">Such rage!</Text>
  <Text ID="256302">Is that a rattle I hear?</Text>
  <Text ID="256303">Out for blood?</Text>
  <Text ID="256304">To a poor old lady?</Text>
  <Text ID="256305">Tush child, how cruel!</Text>
  <Text ID="257945">Proves our enemies are often those closest to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="257946">Declare war, on a frail old lady!?</Text>
  <Text ID="257947">Then death awaits us all.</Text>
  <Text ID="257948">I don't forgive, or forget.</Text>
  <Text ID="257949">Forever a mark beside your name.</Text>
  <Text ID="258438">Your death will come, in time. </Text>
  <Text ID="258439">I wouldn't want you to feel rushed.</Text>
  <Text ID="258440">Contracts can be very dangerous, but alright. </Text>
  <Text ID="258441">Well since you had the courage to negotiate… </Text>
  <Text ID="258442">Why wouldn't I trade with you…</Text>
  <Text ID="258443">I will not forget this. </Text>
  <Text ID="258444">Do not think you alone have plans. </Text>
  <Text ID="258445">I will mark this betrayal. </Text>
  <Text ID="258449">If it is really your wish, we can work together.</Text>
  <Text ID="258450">Child! Why of course you may join the fold.</Text>
  <Text ID="258451">What riches you would deny youself!</Text>
  <Text ID="258452">Oh, I'm not sensitive.</Text>
  <Text ID="257950">I didn't know you were sympathetic to our cause?</Text>
  <Text ID="257951">A little charade? Why not.</Text>
  <Text ID="257952">Oh I think we all know my marriage to Sir Gilbert Hunt was one of convenience.</Text>
  <Text ID="257956">Many accusations, yet not a shred of proof in sight.</Text>
  <Text ID="257957">My my, what a tiger life has made you. Perhaps you'd make a good rug too.</Text>
  <Text ID="257958">Your arrows pass through me. One who has suffered as I have, feels nothing</Text>
  <Text ID="257953">A good servant to the Empire? What a quaint observation. </Text>
  <Text ID="257959">So sweet, like sugar of lead.</Text>
  <Text ID="257960">The words are pleasant enough, but the eyes tell a different story.</Text>
  <Text ID="257961">Lies never really disappear, unlike those who tell them.</Text>
  <Text ID="257954">You know nothing of grief, my brother was my everything!</Text>
  <Text ID="257962">My husband died in his sleep!</Text>
  <Text ID="257963">It is very silly to meddle in matters you know nothing about! </Text>
  <Text ID="257964">We all have our crosses to bear, as you might soon discover.</Text>
  <Text ID="257955">What a kind heart you appear to have.</Text>
  <Text ID="257965">I've always held such sentiments back, but you're right, it could be time to be more direct.</Text>
  <Text ID="257966">Thank you. I place great value in keeping up appearances.</Text>
  <Text ID="257967">How nice. It is always good to have devotees.</Text>
  <Text ID="256306">We have needed one to give us hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="256307">Ambition is seldom a bad thing.</Text>
  <Text ID="256308">We have looked for a star to guide us!</Text>
  <Text ID="256309">Such promise! We hope it will not die young.</Text>
  <Text ID="256310">We all believe in you.</Text>
  <Text ID="256311">You still attract a following from the shadows.</Text>
  <Text ID="256312">Your heart beats yet, child! </Text>
  <Text ID="256313">Memory rekindles happier times.</Text>
  <Text ID="256314">We cannot all be saved, my child.</Text>
  <Text ID="256315">It is hard to let go of prejudice. </Text>
  <Text ID="256316">First impressions count.</Text>
  <Text ID="256317">The smallest cuts leave scars.</Text>
  <Text ID="256318">I'm oft compelled to remember.</Text>
  <Text ID="256319">There is a plan for all of us, child.</Text>
  <Text ID="256320">Some lesions cannot be closed.</Text>
  <Text ID="256321">It's hard to forget sometimes.</Text>
  <Text ID="265622">I always think a narrow selection of friends is better. </Text>
  <Text ID="265623">A closely-knit circle, aren't we? </Text>
  <Text ID="265625">Choose friends carefully.</Text>
  <Text ID="265626">Don't sugar everyone's tea.</Text>
  <Text ID="265628">Friends and foes may often be confused.</Text>
  <Text ID="265629">That was my friend, you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="265631">Dear child, people bring it upon themselves. </Text>
  <Text ID="265632">Oh yes, no need to save face.</Text>
  <Text ID="268049">Our circle is watching your every deceit... </Text>
  <Text ID="268050">But we all know how sneaky you have been…</Text>
  <Text ID="268051">We all play a little false with our enemies.</Text>
  <Text ID="268052">If you were clever enough for them, perhaps… </Text>
  <Text ID="255889">Spare no-one!</Text>
  <Text ID="255890">Destroy them!</Text>
  <Text ID="255891">Behold the night!</Text>
  <Text ID="255892">You cannot hope to stop me.</Text>
  <Text ID="255893">Purge them!</Text>
  <Text ID="255894">Frivolous insolence.</Text>
  <Text ID="255895">You're wasting your time.</Text>
  <Text ID="255896">You will not beat all of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="255897">You're not the first to try.</Text>
  <Text ID="255898">A lack of patience!</Text>
  <Text ID="255899">The name Harlow lives forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="255900">I have vanished you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255901">There is no fighting it.</Text>
  <Text ID="255902">But, we are many! </Text>
  <Text ID="255903">A drop in the ocean.</Text>
  <Text ID="255904">You will not spoil the fireworks.</Text>
  <Text ID="255905">All will be consumed by the tide.</Text>
  <Text ID="255906">Such petty stuctures.</Text>
  <Text ID="255907">That was but a shadow!</Text>
  <Text ID="255908">No! You will not spoil my plans!</Text>
  <Text ID="255909">The things we love, they destroy us.</Text>
  <Text ID="255910">Night embraces you, child.</Text>
  <Text ID="255911">No! It cannot be.</Text>
  <Text ID="255912">You cannot drain what is already dead!</Text>
  <Text ID="255913">And so child, my work is done. Now you die before my eyes, as once my brother did.</Text>
  <Text ID="255914">See how I smile in the dying light...but you, you will depart knowing only terror.</Text>
  <Text ID="255915">Quite right! We should never entirely rely upon others.</Text>
  <Text ID="255916">Allies, they come and go.</Text>
  <Text ID="255917">How can there be peace without justice?</Text>
  <Text ID="255918">For a time you looked the innocent flower…</Text>
  <Text ID="255919">Only natural to protect the ones we love.</Text>
  <Text ID="255920">When times are hard, we must have steel.</Text>
  <Text ID="255921">We are all afraid to lose what we have.</Text>
  <Text ID="255922">What tragedy drives your chariots?</Text>
  <Text ID="255923">Preparation is no substitute for experience.</Text>
  <Text ID="255924">Only fools rush into action.</Text>
  <Text ID="255925">Give up, give up!</Text>
  <Text ID="255926">Ordinary weapons will not work on me.</Text>
  <Text ID="255927">Assist me as was agreed, or you will suffer too.</Text>
  <Text ID="255928">A grave mistake would it be, to break your alliance with me.</Text>
  <Text ID="261352">I have no choice but to punish your friend, but that is no reason for us to quarrel.</Text>
  <Text ID="255929">Of course I shall help you find your way, little duckling.</Text>
  <Text ID="255930">A promise made, is a promise kept.</Text>
  <Text ID="255931">Final hour upon you, and here you are looking for a distraction!</Text>
  <Text ID="255932">Can't bear to see the curtain come down on your own city?</Text>
  <Text ID="255933">They were begging me to challenge you for the longest time.</Text>
  <Text ID="255934">Igne natura renovatur integra.</Text>
  <Text ID="255935">Fly my snakes, sting the breast, and draw your measure.</Text>
  <Text ID="255936">Night's black chariot shall whisk you away!</Text>
  <Text ID="256048">Is it really surprising that they long for change?</Text>
  <Text ID="256049">An uprising, child, has been long overdue. </Text>
  <Text ID="256050">So many years beneath the skin, and now it's free.</Text>
  <Text ID="256051">We shall remain by your bedside until the end.</Text>
  <Text ID="256052">How did you come by a cure?</Text>
  <Text ID="256053">Who found the antidote?</Text>
  <Text ID="256054">Every cloud has a silver lining.</Text>
  <Text ID="256055">Fire is purifying, let it burn.</Text>
  <Text ID="256056">Suffocated, was it?</Text>
  <Text ID="256057">Some fires rage eternal.</Text>
  <Text ID="265498">The whole world will want to come to the opening ceremony.</Text>
  <Text ID="268045">The culmination of mortal hubris!</Text>
  <Text ID="265935">A feral beast to be trussed and neutered.</Text>
  <Text ID="265936">We cannot allow La Corona to gain influence, can we?</Text>
  <Text ID="265938">Don't trouble yourself with such lowly enemies.</Text>
  <Text ID="265947">Raise flags with a lunatic? Unthinkable!</Text>
  <Text ID="265948">La Corona is a rival to my poor dear Queen.</Text>
  <Text ID="265950">Perhaps you can help the silly pariah.</Text>
  <Text ID="268046">Pollution, I fear, is a necessary evil.</Text>
  <Text ID="268047">Do you intend it to be purely commemorative?</Text>
  <Text ID="268048">Happy people do not ask questions.</Text>
  <Text ID="261176">A terrible shame, what happened to your father, dear child.</Text>
  <Text ID="261177">You could be the star all of us have so long waited for.</Text>
  <Text ID="267915">Murder was it? A compelling development.</Text>
  <Text ID="267916">Why would you want to go to the New World, when all you could ever want is right here?</Text>
  <Text ID="261178">Chasing after the past won't make you happy, my dear. Let it go— ring in the future!</Text>
  <Text ID="261179">I imagine the Queen thinks the trial might restore some of her authority.</Text>
  <Text ID="257076">We expect nothing less from your rising star.</Text>

  <Text ID="257626">We can't shut the storeroom door!</Text>
  <Text ID="257627">I hear lack o' storage affects all the factories!</Text>
  <Text ID="257628">There's a major blockage!</Text>
  <Text ID="257629">They're lucky I need this job.</Text>
  <Text ID="257630">Saves trouble, if I do exactly as I'm told.</Text>
  <Text ID="260466">If war is what it takes!</Text>
  <Text ID="260467">You'd hardly call it a war yet.</Text>
  <Text ID="260468">We're all behind you.</Text>
  <Text ID="260469">A civilian can voice his support. </Text>
  <Text ID="260470">From conflict come bold futures.</Text>
  <Text ID="260471">We're a united front.</Text>
  <Text ID="260478">We'll be alright. </Text>
  <Text ID="260479">If there's danger, tell us. </Text>
  <Text ID="260480">Should we be worried now? </Text>
  <Text ID="260564">There's no electric!</Text>
  <Text ID="260565">Oi! Who turned off the lights?</Text>
  <Text ID="260566">We've run out of juice!</Text>
  <Text ID="266166">This production is cat-lap!</Text>
  <Text ID="266167">It's a right old bag o' nails.</Text>
  <Text ID="266168">If nothing works, might as well have stayed at home.</Text>
  <Text ID="266169">I won't be the scapegoat for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="266170">There's a whoppin' spanner in the works.</Text>
  <Text ID="266178">If this place were a racehorse, you'd shoot it.</Text>
  <Text ID="268056">Take it before I change my mind.</Text>
  <Text ID="268057">Help yerself, guv!</Text>
  <Text ID="268058">No chance that'll sprout 'ere, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="268059">That won't grow round here.</Text>
  <Text ID="257292">I'll booze to that.</Text>
  <Text ID="257293">S'what we're in it for!</Text>
  <Text ID="257294">I'd never a' put ha'penny on it!</Text>
  <Text ID="257295">A little carousing in order.</Text>
  <Text ID="257296">Flap the flag o' freedom!</Text>
  <Text ID="257297">Scooped us out the gutter, you did.</Text>
  <Text ID="257298">You ain't half good to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="257299">You've got our interests at heart.</Text>
  <Text ID="257300">We'll raise a glass to you, guv.</Text>
  <Text ID="257301">You give us a voice!</Text>
  <Text ID="257302">We're ready to break some glass. </Text>
  <Text ID="257303">Nothing to feel but hate.</Text>
  <Text ID="257304">Why suffer any longer?</Text>
  <Text ID="257305">Gimme a drink! </Text>
  <Text ID="257306">Grass's greener on t'other side.</Text>
  <Text ID="257307">Don't think we'll play the sheep.</Text>
  <Text ID="257308">We won't be trampled forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="257309">Oppressor!</Text>
  <Text ID="257310">High and mighty, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="257311">Lording it over the working class?</Text>
  <Text ID="257312">No less than we deserve.</Text>
  <Text ID="257313">We earned this.</Text>
  <Text ID="257314">It's our 'uman right.</Text>
  <Text ID="257315">I've no complaint.</Text>
  <Text ID="257316">I'll take it.</Text>
  <Text ID="257317">So be it.</Text>
  <Text ID="257318">Must be mad.</Text>
  <Text ID="257319">We ain't animals!</Text>
  <Text ID="257320">It's a slur!</Text>
  <Text ID="257321">Pamphlets, pickets, healthy, honest protest. If some silver-spoon stiffs wants to deny us that, we'll take them shiny spoons and shove 'em...</Text>
  <Text ID="257322">Digs is full o' kids. More likely find me out and about of an evening, seeing what's what.</Text>
  <Text ID="257323">No harm in a bit of fun, a bit of filth. Keeps the oil lit, when work's waned yer wick. </Text>
  <Text ID="257324">New unionism's is our future. Us filings swept into an iron tide. The rattle of the workers! Freedom and equality for all!</Text>
  <Text ID="257325">My folks were farmers. Stink o' manure or stink o' grease, makes no odds so long as you're paid.</Text>
  <Text ID="257326">I'll do ten of what a namby-pamby artisan do a day. Moany bourgeois milksops. </Text>
  <Text ID="257327">I respects Engineers, right bobbish with the machines. Never know what bit of me's getting chewed up next!</Text>
  <Text ID="257328">Investors? Crushing youth in the jaws of their machines? Trading on us like goods? Makes my bloody blood boil!</Text>
  <Text ID="257329">You want a road, guv.</Text>
  <Text ID="257330">Respect your streets!</Text>
  <Text ID="257331">Help us out, won't ya boss?</Text>
  <Text ID="257332">Spare a thought for us?</Text>
  <Text ID="257333">Far be it from us to make the foreman work...</Text>
  <Text ID="257334">I'm only a cog, it's you what pulls the levers.</Text>
  <Text ID="257335">Grease the wheels, gov'nor...?</Text>
  <Text ID="257336">A load off me bones.</Text>
  <Text ID="257337">Good luck guv.</Text>
  <Text ID="257338">Right y'are.</Text>
  <Text ID="257339">Another ten years off my life.</Text>
  <Text ID="257340">You hoity-toities are all the same.</Text>
  <Text ID="257341">I see how it is.</Text>
  <Text ID="257342">We'd never turn on ours.</Text>
  <Text ID="257343">Not worth the time?!</Text>
  <Text ID="257344">Let's hear it then.</Text>
  <Text ID="257345">Got news?</Text>
  <Text ID="257346">Spill the sauce.</Text>
  <Text ID="257347">Cor, a promise kept!</Text>
  <Text ID="257348">A little love's all we ever wanted.</Text>
  <Text ID="257349">Not bad for a big boss!</Text>
  <Text ID="257350">Assembly line never stops...</Text>
  <Text ID="257351">Chin up boss, we ain't finished.</Text>
  <Text ID="257353">Push the right button.</Text>
  <Text ID="257354">We've always been loyal!</Text>
  <Text ID="257355">Are we to be looked over?</Text>
  <Text ID="257356">Haven't you ever wanted help, guv?</Text>
  <Text ID="257357">I'm never afraid to ask twice!</Text>
  <Text ID="257358">These are good times, could they even be better?</Text>
  <Text ID="257359">I'm happy as sandboy, will you build us another castle?</Text>
  <Text ID="257360">Will you work your magic for us, what we do so love to see?</Text>
  <Text ID="257367">All we're asking for is protection! </Text>
  <Text ID="257368">We have a right to marine safety!</Text>
  <Text ID="257369">Can you guarantee our safe passage?</Text>
  <Text ID="254185">A future bright and gay!</Text>
  <Text ID="254186">Warm sun floods the meadow!</Text>
  <Text ID="254187">Rose cheeks and merriment.</Text>
  <Text ID="254188">What a time to be alive!</Text>
  <Text ID="254189">Sweet music!</Text>
  <Text ID="254190">Heard above the madding crowd!</Text>
  <Text ID="254191">Purest zephyrs raise you!</Text>
  <Text ID="254192">O' sweet fancy, bless you!</Text>
  <Text ID="254193">Hail to thee, high above the rest!</Text>
  <Text ID="254194">What a happy vision of yours!</Text>
  <Text ID="254195">Must beauty die so?!</Text>
  <Text ID="254196">The jaws of anxiety open.</Text>
  <Text ID="254197">Drowned in the brook, rue buds in hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="254198">The terror of this age!</Text>
  <Text ID="254199">Ash white, like death.</Text>
  <Text ID="254200">Have pity, I cannot sleep!</Text>
  <Text ID="254201">Shapeless horrors climb from your abyss.</Text>
  <Text ID="254202">Am I being punished?</Text>
  <Text ID="254203">You create a monster!</Text>
  <Text ID="254204">Offer me not a poison chalice!</Text>
  <Text ID="254205">I should be honoured!</Text>
  <Text ID="254206">Much to be thankful for!</Text>
  <Text ID="254207">I am humbled!</Text>
  <Text ID="254208">Assuredly!</Text>
  <Text ID="254209">On impulse, yes!</Text>
  <Text ID="254210">Whyever not!</Text>
  <Text ID="254211">I beg you, no!</Text>
  <Text ID="254212">I prithee, no!</Text>
  <Text ID="254213">Anything but that!</Text>
  <Text ID="254214">My work is the love of my life, instinct over thought. You could even call it art! </Text>
  <Text ID="254215">The truest work of art is but a shadow of its friend in nature.</Text>
  <Text ID="254216">Someone once told me they didn't like my work, I threw myself in a nettle patch.</Text>
  <Text ID="254217">I hope I'm not too caught-up to remember to eat once in a while!</Text>
  <Text ID="254218">Investors enjoy the fruits of my labour, but I wonder if they know much of the tree.</Text>
  <Text ID="254219">Engineers deride art. But true beauty lies not in things seen, but those unseen.</Text>
  <Text ID="254220">Pity the workers! When I think of their dreary struggle, I know how fortunate I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="254221">A farmer's life may be humblest. But green pastures, hands swept through corn, that is God's idyll!</Text>
  <Text ID="257634">Carts do not love long grass as we do.</Text>
  <Text ID="257635">A road would be the classical choice.</Text>
  <Text ID="254222">Save me from this tortuous perplexity?</Text>
  <Text ID="254223">Can any friend lift this daemon cloud?</Text>
  <Text ID="254224">I fear my plea shan't be heard above common tumult.</Text>
  <Text ID="254225">Even with aid, I fear it shall not be enough. </Text>
  <Text ID="254226">Help, my brief candle extinguishes!</Text>
  <Text ID="254227">Perhaps then, I may hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="254228">I do not merit this kindness.</Text>
  <Text ID="254229">Dare I dream?</Text>
  <Text ID="254230">It is I who have failed.</Text>
  <Text ID="254231">Fate poureth poison in mine ear.</Text>
  <Text ID="254232">Then none shall temper this torment.</Text>
  <Text ID="254233">Then I must to my work, it is all I have.</Text>
  <Text ID="254234">That one briefly cared, should mean something. </Text>
  <Text ID="254235">You bring meaning to my existence?</Text>
  <Text ID="254236">You wield the torch of hope?</Text>
  <Text ID="254237">I see a fleeting figure upon the hill!</Text>
  <Text ID="254238">Rapture! Rejuvenation!</Text>
  <Text ID="254239">Wild abandon courses through every limb! </Text>
  <Text ID="254240">We have cause for urgent celebration!</Text>
  <Text ID="257703">I am giddy with gratitude!</Text>
  <Text ID="257704">Rainbows follow you!</Text>
  <Text ID="254241">You do so much, dare I ask again?</Text>
  <Text ID="254242">I'd be full of cheer, were not fresh malady upon me ... </Text>
  <Text ID="254243">Might another barren cherry be brought to blossom?</Text>
  <Text ID="254244">Choose not the rich, but the beautiful.</Text>
  <Text ID="254245">Believe in more than the obvious!</Text>
  <Text ID="257636">Might I one day be remembered...</Text>
  <Text ID="257637">May I still dream?</Text>
  <Text ID="257638">Do I ask too much?</Text>
  <Text ID="257639">Oh for a chance of some companion ship…?</Text>
  <Text ID="257640">I have long dreamt of caravans.</Text>
  <Text ID="257641">Does a heavenly cortege precede us?</Text>
  <Text ID="257642">From this bright moon, I am yet greedy for starlight!</Text>
  <Text ID="257643">A victim of my own satisfaction, I fear I become "entitled".</Text>
  <Text ID="257644">This must appear ungrateful, what with all I have already.</Text>
  <Text ID="254246">All I ever desired was a place to live and work!</Text>
  <Text ID="260499">Once bright blossom now rotting stench!</Text>
  <Text ID="260500">I care not even for my craft.</Text>
  <Text ID="260501">We are a dying dream!</Text>
  <Text ID="260502">Bound in poison ivy!</Text>
  <Text ID="260503">Despair, may it all end soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="260504">My soul to the devil, or anyone!</Text>
  <Text ID="260505">If god exists, he is too cruel! </Text>
  <Text ID="260506">Piteous hole, a sickness of the soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="260507">All of my life, for nothing!</Text>
  <Text ID="260508">Like Persephone, I count my days in hell.</Text>
  <Text ID="254264">Glum meadows, whose droop-head flowers lament.   </Text>
  <Text ID="254265">Strangled by serpents of temptation.</Text>
  <Text ID="254266">A dead pool yearning for some spawn of hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="254267">Bitter sap bleeds this tree.</Text>
  <Text ID="254268">I weep and weep as the willow.</Text>
  <Text ID="254269">I would gladly drown among the reeds.</Text>
  <Text ID="254270">I'd grasp a wild swan, and fly where'er it flew. </Text>
  <Text ID="254271">I hold no hope of tomorrows.</Text>
  <Text ID="254272">My life is a tragedy.</Text>
  <Text ID="254273">The illusion is broken.</Text>
  <Text ID="254274">I dream of better.  </Text>
  <Text ID="254275">My ambitions exist mainly in the imagination!</Text>
  <Text ID="254276">I see-saw between have and have-not. </Text>
  <Text ID="254277">Mine is a life half-lived.</Text>
  <Text ID="254278">An aviary is fine, when it look not over forest.</Text>
  <Text ID="254279">Is it wrong to want more?</Text>
  <Text ID="254280">It's shallow, but some luxury wouldn't hurt. </Text>
  <Text ID="254281">Things are somewhat humdrum.</Text>
  <Text ID="254282">Life is like sea-water, that only deepens one's thirst.</Text>
  <Text ID="254283">I feel unfulfilled.</Text>
  <Text ID="254284">So many like-minded souls!</Text>
  <Text ID="254285">Full of gladness, I make my best work!</Text>
  <Text ID="254286">I soar in heaven's bright chariot. </Text>
  <Text ID="254287">I feel nought but a ragged joy.</Text>
  <Text ID="254288">In this gentle bough, am I quite content. </Text>
  <Text ID="254289">Happy melodies spring from the lyre!</Text>
  <Text ID="254290">Life here is a wonder.</Text>
  <Text ID="254291">My soul has leave to express itself.</Text>
  <Text ID="254292">I am bleary-eyed with bliss.</Text>
  <Text ID="254293">Such luxury!</Text>
  <Text ID="254294">A floodplain awash with milk and honey!</Text>
  <Text ID="254295">This glittering carousel dizzies me, as I ascend!</Text>
  <Text ID="254296">Euphoria! I am possessed by the demons of ecstasy!</Text>
  <Text ID="254297">Heady paradisiacal nectars intoxicate me!</Text>
  <Text ID="254298">A canopy of stars, each an exclamation of joy!</Text>
  <Text ID="254299">My materials! My sketches!</Text>
  <Text ID="254300">Flaming demons seize all I own!</Text>
  <Text ID="254301">Fiery fiends cavort through my reality!</Text>
  <Text ID="254302">A biblical plague upon me!</Text>
  <Text ID="254303">Should I die of this sickness, I pray my art shall live on.</Text>
  <Text ID="254304">Bed-ridden, under a halo of death.</Text>
  <Text ID="254305">No good comes of evil!</Text>
  <Text ID="254306">Justice here on earth!</Text>
  <Text ID="254307">None dictate to my heart!</Text>
  <Text ID="254317">Who cannot in good conscience speak out?</Text>
  <Text ID="254318">I refuse to romanticise these conditions!</Text>
  <Text ID="254319">Injustice leaves me too weak for work.</Text>
  <Text ID="254320">Caged trees will hold back their fruit.</Text>
  <Text ID="254321">Know that I do not betray my craft.</Text>
  <Text ID="254322">Trying to remember what it is I'll need to do.</Text>
  <Text ID="254323">Always hard to pick up where you leave off.</Text>
  <Text ID="254324">I'll use the time for a little think, I think.</Text>
  <Text ID="254325">Oh of course, silly me.</Text>
  <Text ID="254326">How spontaneous!</Text>
  <Text ID="254327">So sorry, right away!</Text>
  <Text ID="257654">The finishing touches, and.. there!</Text>
  <Text ID="257655">Everything's rather fragile.</Text>
  <Text ID="257656">Always harder with someone at your shoulder.</Text>
  <Text ID="257657">I had better leave it to set.</Text>
  <Text ID="257658">Confounded tricky, this stage.</Text>
  <Text ID="257659">Force caged birds to sing?</Text>
  <Text ID="257660">My spontaneity is gone.</Text>
  <Text ID="257661">What ripe fruit needs shaking from its tree?</Text>
  <Text ID="257662">I long to be unbound.</Text>
  <Text ID="257663">A crocus buds at its own pace!</Text>
  <Text ID="257669">Leisure sparks the mind!</Text>
  <Text ID="257670">Free to trust my impulses!</Text>
  <Text ID="257671">A morning is all I need.</Text>
  <Text ID="257672">There's room for thought.</Text>
  <Text ID="257673">My imagination is always at work, even if I am not.</Text>
  <Text ID="257677">Hell issues its flaming critique!</Text>
  <Text ID="257678">Please! My life burns! </Text>
  <Text ID="257679">Cholera, Malaria, Influenza, perhaps all three!</Text>
  <Text ID="257680">I feel ill, oh do I look ill? I'm going to die aren't I?</Text>
  <Text ID="257681">Pause for thought?</Text>
  <Text ID="257682">I can return to it later.</Text>
  <Text ID="257683">I shall not ask the forwhys!</Text>
  <Text ID="257689">We don't have all the space we need.</Text>
  <Text ID="257690">Our manufactory is incomplete.</Text>
  <Text ID="257691">If only there were more of me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257692">There are not enough hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="257693">I'm missing particular materials.</Text>
  <Text ID="257694">I don't have all needed for my canvas.</Text>
  <Text ID="257695">In my imagination, I see a warehouse.</Text>
  <Text ID="257696">In my mind's eye, a warehouse revealed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257697">Oh, have I made too many?</Text>
  <Text ID="257698">I had no idea I was so prolific!</Text>
  <Text ID="257701">I'm lost in the reverie of my craft.</Text>
  <Text ID="257702">If labour is solitary, so then are the rewards!</Text>
  <Text ID="260527">It is but a passing tempest!</Text>
  <Text ID="260528">Beyond the field of battle, beds of sweet lavender.  </Text>
  <Text ID="260529">If we must have war, we shall win!</Text>
  <Text ID="260567">We shall not weary, but fight the eagle's grasp!</Text>
  <Text ID="260568">Will another glorious field be won this day?</Text>
  <Text ID="260569">I can already feel the swell of triumph!</Text>
  <Text ID="260552">Please, don't let them hurt me!</Text>
  <Text ID="260553">I am terribly, terribly afraid.</Text>
  <Text ID="260554">We will soon be grieving over the dead!</Text>
  <Text ID="260603">We're quite out of energy!</Text>
  <Text ID="260604">We feel powerless!</Text>
  <Text ID="260605">There is simply no spark!</Text>
  <Text ID="266161">I am a failure!</Text>
  <Text ID="266162">May as well finish me.</Text>
  <Text ID="266163">Nothingness.</Text>
  <Text ID="266164">I'm a useless donkey.</Text>
  <Text ID="266165">I've always been a dunce!</Text>
  <Text ID="266179">All I produce is tears.</Text>
  <Text ID="266180">This place is a void!</Text>
  <Text ID="268060">I know it cannot match the gifts of Nature, but here...</Text>
  <Text ID="268061">None other deserves this masterpiece!</Text>
  <Text ID="268062">Demeter will not permit such fruit here!</Text>
  <Text ID="268063">It would be unnatural to grow that here.</Text>
  <Text ID="255757">I shall evaluate this habitation, before I draw any conclusions.</Text>
  <Text ID="260612">On the brink of eruption!</Text>
  <Text ID="260613">Who neglects their affairs in this way!</Text>
  <Text ID="260614">Absolute zero!</Text>
  <Text ID="260615">My reaction is not remotely extreme!</Text>
  <Text ID="260616">I am positively indignant!</Text>
  <Text ID="260617">Categorically unacceptable!</Text>
  <Text ID="260618">A failed experiment!</Text>
  <Text ID="260619">A place where ignorance abounds!</Text>
  <Text ID="260620">I am one negative particle!</Text>
  <Text ID="260621">Life must improve by a factor of 1000!</Text>
  <Text ID="255758">I struggle to find recognition. </Text>
  <Text ID="255802">No-one here listens.</Text>
  <Text ID="255803">The facts speak for themselves.</Text>
  <Text ID="255804">This atmosphere is corrosive.</Text>
  <Text ID="255805">Statistically, we're miserable.</Text>
  <Text ID="255806">I've made a comprehensive list of changes. (crossly)</Text>
  <Text ID="255807">Weak structures collapse.</Text>
  <Text ID="255808">I shoud take my intellect elsewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="255809">How am I supposed to concentrate?</Text>
  <Text ID="255810">I wonder if I am being overlooked. </Text>
  <Text ID="255759">I have a feeling of inertia.</Text>
  <Text ID="255811">I'd achieve more in a better habitat.</Text>
  <Text ID="255812">It's only a half-life.</Text>
  <Text ID="255813">The setting is derivative.</Text>
  <Text ID="255814">We're only just above the median.</Text>
  <Text ID="255815">This place is full of unresolved equations.</Text>
  <Text ID="255816">The pendulum swings between contentment and consternation…</Text>
  <Text ID="255817">Life here is rather static.</Text>
  <Text ID="255818">It's certainly not the perfect formula.</Text>
  <Text ID="255819">I have to be resourceful.</Text>
  <Text ID="255760">The place is magnetic.</Text>
  <Text ID="255820">I am measurably content.</Text>
  <Text ID="255821">I am quite satisfied, thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255822">We are galvanised.</Text>
  <Text ID="255823">These are fluid dynamics!</Text>
  <Text ID="255824">I'm cheery as a coiled spring.</Text>
  <Text ID="255825">Qualitative assessments show promise.</Text>
  <Text ID="255826">My cupboards are quite replete.</Text>
  <Text ID="255827">My theses proceed without hitch.</Text>
  <Text ID="255828">I feel an integral part here.</Text>
  <Text ID="255761">Eureka!</Text>
  <Text ID="255829">The golden ratio.</Text>
  <Text ID="255830">Do I breathe laughing gas?!</Text>
  <Text ID="255831">The place is electric!</Text>
  <Text ID="255832">I'm so thrilled I may evaporate.</Text>
  <Text ID="255762">To the floor! There's too much smoke.</Text>
  <Text ID="255833">Quickly, man the hydrants!</Text>
  <Text ID="255834">Please someone, alert the brigade!</Text>
  <Text ID="255763">If only I were well enough to find a cure…</Text>
  <Text ID="255835">I am too weak to inspect the cause of the contagion…</Text>
  <Text ID="255836">I'm usually so independent, but this illness…</Text>
  <Text ID="255764">This is not merely a surface tension!</Text>
  <Text ID="255837">I am a part of these frictions!</Text>
  <Text ID="255838">I put up extreme resistance!</Text>
  <Text ID="257816">Do not mind the odd jet of steam!</Text>
  <Text ID="257817">Curious?</Text>
  <Text ID="257818">Cover your ears!</Text>
  <Text ID="257819">We've taken to wearing hard hats here. </Text>
  <Text ID="257820">Welcome to the manufactory.</Text>
  <Text ID="257821">The hours are very demanding, I must persevere.</Text>
  <Text ID="257822">This modus operandi cannot continue.</Text>
  <Text ID="257823">I realise progress is never swift or easy, but...</Text>
  <Text ID="257824">I feel stressed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257825">Curiosity should be increasing proportional to effort… </Text>
  <Text ID="257831">I have generous allowances of leave.</Text>
  <Text ID="257832">Plenty of time to pop to the library.</Text>
  <Text ID="257833">There is breathing space between projects.</Text>
  <Text ID="257834">I would never use the word "relaxed".</Text>
  <Text ID="257835">I have the time, I ought to visit my old tutors.</Text>
  <Text ID="257836">I am swayed by emotional arguments. </Text>
  <Text ID="257837">I should patent this form of protest.</Text>
  <Text ID="257838">It takes courage to do what I do.</Text>
  <Text ID="257839">I will not press that button.</Text>
  <Text ID="257840">Clear evidence we are unhappy.</Text>
  <Text ID="257844">My research!</Text>
  <Text ID="257845">Industrial sabotage, workers perhaps?</Text>
  <Text ID="257846">The place must be throughly decontaminated!</Text>
  <Text ID="257847">Seal off the outbreak!</Text>
  <Text ID="257848">A layer of dust is forming.</Text>
  <Text ID="257849">The tubes await some throughput.</Text>
  <Text ID="257850">We are keen to resume as soon as permitted.</Text>
  <Text ID="257851">Engage the brakes!</Text>
  <Text ID="257852">Seal the valves!</Text>
  <Text ID="257853">Now where was that master switch?</Text>
  <Text ID="257854">Start the machines!</Text>
  <Text ID="257855">Carefully, I say!</Text>
  <Text ID="257856">Soon be back to speed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257889">We are missing a central facility!</Text>
  <Text ID="257890">And the auxilliary assembly area?</Text>
  <Text ID="257891">Just one or two brains isn't enough!</Text>
  <Text ID="257894">This requires a larger think tank.</Text>
  <Text ID="257892">We miss all elements to produce a reaction!</Text>
  <Text ID="257895">The formula is incomplete.</Text>
  <Text ID="257893">There is a logistical problem.</Text>
  <Text ID="257896">Our creations must be stored in warehouses.</Text>
  <Text ID="257897">There's no space for any more.</Text>
  <Text ID="257898">We have reached capacity.</Text>
  <Text ID="257901">Contrary to popular belief, I don't mind dirtying my hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="257902">It's not all cogs and gears you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="260622">Perhaps war will spur scientific growth.</Text>
  <Text ID="260623">Conflict can sometimes be a catalyst.</Text>
  <Text ID="260624">War is always a litmus test for technology.</Text>
  <Text ID="260625">Our chances look good on paper.</Text>
  <Text ID="260626">Unless the situation changes, I'll keep to my work.</Text>
  <Text ID="260627">Calculations show we are quite safe for the moment. </Text>
  <Text ID="260633">I'm sorry I'm no military engineer.</Text>
  <Text ID="260634">If I could only fashion a grenado…</Text>
  <Text ID="260635">I wish I'd studied military science.</Text>
  <Text ID="260822">Electricity is essential!</Text>
  <Text ID="260823">Did you forget to flick the switch?</Text>
  <Text ID="260824">Direct current now!</Text>
  <Text ID="266156">I can't blame the machines!</Text>
  <Text ID="266157">Calculations are severely amiss!</Text>
  <Text ID="266158">What is the reason for this failure?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266159">We must revisit the manual at once!</Text>
  <Text ID="266160">Operation should have been simple!</Text>
  <Text ID="266181">We would be better off with cave tools!</Text>
  <Text ID="266182">It does not yet function well.</Text>
  <Text ID="268064">It is only logical to reward desirable behaviours. </Text>
  <Text ID="268065">Positive reinforcement is crucial for optimal conditioning.</Text>
  <Text ID="268066">The soil's pH is unsuitable for this crop.</Text>
  <Text ID="268067">This is no autochthonous species.</Text>
  <Text ID="257707">My analysis is positive.</Text>
  <Text ID="257708">Unprecedented!</Text>
  <Text ID="257709">Why didn't I think of this?!</Text>
  <Text ID="257710">Better than I predicted.</Text>
  <Text ID="257711">Elegant solution!</Text>
  <Text ID="257712">You have the spark!</Text>
  <Text ID="257713">You more than pass the test!</Text>
  <Text ID="257714">You reach the limits of the possible!</Text>
  <Text ID="257715">You've found your algorhythm!</Text>
  <Text ID="257716">You share my own curiosity!</Text>
  <Text ID="257717">A fraction of what it should be.</Text>
  <Text ID="257718">Suboptimal.</Text>
  <Text ID="257719">My focus is destroyed.</Text>
  <Text ID="257720">Null and void.</Text>
  <Text ID="257721">How do I concentrate?!</Text>
  <Text ID="257722">Do your projects lack scientific rigour?</Text>
  <Text ID="257723">Is now the time for experimentation?</Text>
  <Text ID="257724">Do you always plan ahead?</Text>
  <Text ID="257725">Your methods raise questions.</Text>
  <Text ID="257726">I prefer to think before I leap!</Text>
  <Text ID="257727">Good heavens, a breakthrough?</Text>
  <Text ID="257728">No need for hyperbole, but thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="257729">It is irrational to expect such kindness.</Text>
  <Text ID="257730">I reciprocate.</Text>
  <Text ID="257731">An axiomatic truth.</Text>
  <Text ID="257732">I see no flaw.</Text>
  <Text ID="257733">I will not.</Text>
  <Text ID="257734">Impossible.</Text>
  <Text ID="257735">Negative.</Text>
  <Text ID="257736">The other day someone mistook me for an engineer's wife. Seems I must work twice as hard for half the recognition.</Text>
  <Text ID="257737">The base ingredients for life are all I need to thrive. Water, fuel, shelter, warmth, a laboratory, a housekeeper ...and so on.</Text>
  <Text ID="257738">A colleague builds a device to compute anything! In science, it is things that interest us, not persons.</Text>
  <Text ID="257739">Nothing remotely strange about a person such as myself pushing back the boundaries of what we presume to know. There is nothing else I can imagine wanting.</Text>
  <Text ID="257740">"That's how we've always done it," farmers like to say. But good science will churn the alluvials of tradition.</Text>
  <Text ID="257741">I do need to simplify my instructions for the workers, lest they find another reason to complain.</Text>
  <Text ID="257742">I don't pretend to understand Artisans. Art is science. Elegant, beautiful, yet fit for purpose.</Text>
  <Text ID="257743">Investors do not value fact. I find it entirely regrettable to have to sell innovation with bluster, when scientific proofs speak the advantages plain.</Text>
  <Text ID="257744">No road, whatever next!?</Text>
  <Text ID="257745">We need a path to progress.</Text>
  <Text ID="257746">May I present a conundrum?</Text>
  <Text ID="257747">Can the following problem be solved?</Text>
  <Text ID="257748">I am on the verge of a breakthrough!</Text>
  <Text ID="257749">Perhaps there is a way to put theory into practice?</Text>
  <Text ID="257750">Can this enigma be decoded?</Text>
  <Text ID="257751">I hope to see the workings.</Text>
  <Text ID="257752">I eagerly await results.</Text>
  <Text ID="257753">Probability of success, uncertain.</Text>
  <Text ID="257754">Oh dear, combustion!</Text>
  <Text ID="257755">Science is trial and error.</Text>
  <Text ID="257756">Failure is always the most likely outcome.</Text>
  <Text ID="257757">How unpredictable.</Text>
  <Text ID="257758">I must recheck the constants and variables!</Text>
  <Text ID="257759">Is there a solution?</Text>
  <Text ID="257760">Does it all snap into place?</Text>
  <Text ID="257761">Bridging the gap?</Text>
  <Text ID="257762">A fine catalyst!</Text>
  <Text ID="257763">So very coefficient.</Text>
  <Text ID="257764">Quod erat demonstrandum.</Text>
  <Text ID="257767">My work is a continuum...</Text>
  <Text ID="257768">Let us move on to the next phase...</Text>
  <Text ID="257770">I let facts speak for themselves!</Text>
  <Text ID="257771">The answer seems rather plain to me.</Text>
  <Text ID="257772">Would it help to have it in writing?</Text>
  <Text ID="257773">My work too, wants patience.</Text>
  <Text ID="257774">I am an excellent timekeeper.</Text>
  <Text ID="257775">A good engineer always has contigencies.</Text>
  <Text ID="257776">I am escorted because of my importance.</Text>
  <Text ID="257777">We must beware of alternative currents.</Text>
  <Text ID="257778">Now the possibilities are limitless!</Text>
  <Text ID="257779">However happy I am, the desire to improve never ceases. </Text>
  <Text ID="257780">We must not rest on our laurels!</Text>
  <Text ID="254356">Capital.</Text>
  <Text ID="254357">High calibre.</Text>
  <Text ID="254358">Surprisingly decent.</Text>
  <Text ID="254359">By Jove! </Text>
  <Text ID="254360">It's the bee's knees.</Text>
  <Text ID="254361">Very forward-thinking!</Text>
  <Text ID="254362">Bold as brass.</Text>
  <Text ID="254363">Slick work.</Text>
  <Text ID="254364">How shrewd.</Text>
  <Text ID="254365">You've got the credentials.</Text>
  <Text ID="254366">A farce from start to finish!</Text>
  <Text ID="254367">Nothing short of disaster.</Text>
  <Text ID="254368">Catastrophic.</Text>
  <Text ID="254369">Doesn't cut the mustard.</Text>
  <Text ID="254370">A disgrace!</Text>
  <Text ID="254371">You scotched my dividends!</Text>
  <Text ID="254372">Your "strategy" is flawed!</Text>
  <Text ID="254373">Where's your bottle?</Text>
  <Text ID="254374">Bad form.</Text>
  <Text ID="254375">Boots too big for you?</Text>
  <Text ID="254376">Credit where credit's due.</Text>
  <Text ID="254377">My heartfelt gratitude.</Text>
  <Text ID="254378">Worthy of the plaudits!</Text>
  <Text ID="254379">Tally-ho!</Text>
  <Text ID="254380">We can move on this.</Text>
  <Text ID="254381">Motion approved.</Text>
  <Text ID="254382">Absurd!</Text>
  <Text ID="254383">Beneath me!</Text>
  <Text ID="254384">Not up to snuff.</Text>
  <Text ID="254385">Going down to the country soon, spot of shooting, then back to the razzle-dazzle.</Text>
  <Text ID="254386">I either eat the best, or I don't eat.</Text>
  <Text ID="254387">When you're used to the top rung, most of life becomes pretty ordinary.</Text>
  <Text ID="254388">Third house needs work, wrought-iron gate keeps jamming shut, demn thing. Always something draining pocket!</Text>
  <Text ID="254389">Farmers? Didn't know we still had the blighters! Come to think of it, did see some wretches plodding about the estate; probably poaching my grouse!</Text>
  <Text ID="254390">Workers are dim drones to Queen bee. Still, we need someone to do the dirty, if we're to drag this city kicking and screaming into the future.</Text>
  <Text ID="254391">Nothing worse than those bohemians. An artisan has not even the most basic concept of money.</Text>
  <Text ID="254392">Engineers are the keystones. Stuff they come up with boggles the mind! The least we owe is to get them down from the attic and into normal society.</Text>
  <Text ID="258012">No road? What is this, the ruddy north pole?</Text>
  <Text ID="258013">Have you lost your mind, we need a road?</Text>
  <Text ID="254393">I expect a high standard of service...</Text>
  <Text ID="254394">See to this pronto...</Text>
  <Text ID="254395">Rather a rum situation wotwot...</Text>
  <Text ID="254396">I've need of you my good fellow...</Text>
  <Text ID="254397">This business puts me off my swing!</Text>
  <Text ID="254398">Pip-pip.</Text>
  <Text ID="254399">Toodle-oo!</Text>
  <Text ID="254400">There's a good sport.</Text>
  <Text ID="254401">Do you know who I am?!</Text>
  <Text ID="254402">Rarely have I seen such incompetence.</Text>
  <Text ID="254403">I'm not accustomed to failure!</Text>
  <Text ID="254404">I demand a written apology!</Text>
  <Text ID="254405">Explain yourself!</Text>
  <Text ID="254406">Cruising home?</Text>
  <Text ID="254407">Ready to show your class?</Text>
  <Text ID="254408">Steaming up to the platform?</Text>
  <Text ID="254409">Just what the doctor ordered.</Text>
  <Text ID="254410">Ah, the very thing!</Text>
  <Text ID="254411">Dashed splendid old soldier.</Text>
  <Text ID="254412">Market's collapsing again...</Text>
  <Text ID="254413">The picalilli just got tangier...</Text>
  <Text ID="254415">Big decisions need a big pair of slippers...</Text>
  <Text ID="254416">You have a duty to your backers!</Text>
  <Text ID="258016">What is taking so long?</Text>
  <Text ID="258017">I've never been made to wait before.</Text>
  <Text ID="258018">Isn't there some way I can jump the queue?</Text>
  <Text ID="258022">We linchpins of the economy must have an escort.</Text>
  <Text ID="258023">Doesn't protection come as standard?</Text>
  <Text ID="258024">As a first class ticket holder, I am entitled to a chaperon.</Text>
  <Text ID="258025">This would be the cherry on the cake.</Text>
  <Text ID="258026">All going swimmingly, but for this…</Text>
  <Text ID="258027">After all, there's always something more to be done!</Text>
  <Text ID="254417">I have every right to have high expectations...</Text>
  <Text ID="260572">Do you not see I'm incandescent?!</Text>
  <Text ID="260573">These conditions are an insult!</Text>
  <Text ID="260574">Not even the balustrades are burnished!</Text>
  <Text ID="260575">Just plain rude!</Text>
  <Text ID="260576">You will improve my situation at once!</Text>
  <Text ID="260577">It's tattier here than a pauper's trouser!</Text>
  <Text ID="260578">Of course I'm going to say what I think!</Text>
  <Text ID="260579">This city is an abomination!</Text>
  <Text ID="260580">The service is ruddy despicable!</Text>
  <Text ID="260581">I demand every appurtenance of my station! </Text>
  <Text ID="254435">The environs are quite frankly, ghastly.</Text>
  <Text ID="254436">Housekeeper's a disgrace, can't get anything in!</Text>
  <Text ID="254437">This is not what I ordered!</Text>
  <Text ID="254438">I feel like drowning myself in the en suite.</Text>
  <Text ID="254439">Place is an absolewt shambles!</Text>
  <Text ID="254440">How about a lick of paint once in a while?</Text>
  <Text ID="254441">The décor is utterly grotesque.</Text>
  <Text ID="254442">This is a tawdry spot. </Text>
  <Text ID="254443">The place is a hole.</Text>
  <Text ID="254444">I'd rather be a fox among hounds. </Text>
  <Text ID="254445">I'm used to the best, and this isn't it.</Text>
  <Text ID="254446">Fundamentally average.</Text>
  <Text ID="254447">Why aren't there more banquettes here and there?</Text>
  <Text ID="254448">The ambience is passable.</Text>
  <Text ID="254449">Adequate, but lacking finesse.</Text>
  <Text ID="254450">Not nearly as upmarket as I was led to believe.</Text>
  <Text ID="254451">It's a little bit dated.</Text>
  <Text ID="254452">It's hardly special here is it?</Text>
  <Text ID="254453">Justa about meets standard.</Text>
  <Text ID="254454">The millieu is merely ordinary.</Text>
  <Text ID="254455">I feel a certain joie de vivre.</Text>
  <Text ID="254456">Not too shabby.</Text>
  <Text ID="254457">This is half-decent.</Text>
  <Text ID="254458">We are reasonably situated.</Text>
  <Text ID="254459">This is quite the stomping ground.</Text>
  <Text ID="254460">Used to the best, this isn't the worst.</Text>
  <Text ID="254461">Very fine, I'll say.</Text>
  <Text ID="254462">A comely locale.</Text>
  <Text ID="254463">All going smoothly.</Text>
  <Text ID="254464">Good waters for sharks.</Text>
  <Text ID="254465">This is the gold standard.</Text>
  <Text ID="254466">Cream whip, and toppity-top.</Text>
  <Text ID="254467">The city's a ruddy marvel I tell you.</Text>
  <Text ID="254468">A sumptuous setting.</Text>
  <Text ID="254469">The most delectable district!</Text>
  <Text ID="254470">My lawyer shall hear of this conflagration!</Text>
  <Text ID="254471">My apartments go up in smoke!</Text>
  <Text ID="254472">My 16th century landscape better have survived!</Text>
  <Text ID="254473">I never get ill!</Text>
  <Text ID="254474">Don't people know how to use a handkerchief?</Text>
  <Text ID="254475">Someone fetch the demn doctor!</Text>
  <Text ID="254476">I won't back a horse with a fetlock!</Text>
  <Text ID="254477">I'll do nothing until the board has its say!</Text>
  <Text ID="254478">I am not responsible for your rack and ruin!</Text>
  <Text ID="260582">The enemy has no chance of crashing our economy!</Text>
  <Text ID="260583">The enemy won't rock our boat, eh! </Text>
  <Text ID="260584">We're as safe as my nest egg.</Text>
  <Text ID="260585">I'm confident this island is impregnable!</Text>
  <Text ID="260586">Trust me, this rock is absolutely secure!</Text>
  <Text ID="260587">A war might even boost the markets.</Text>
  <Text ID="260594">For god's sake keep us safe can't you!?</Text>
  <Text ID="260595">The invaders will know who I am!</Text>
  <Text ID="260596">I will not be a prisoner in my own home!</Text>
  <Text ID="254527">Which basket, for all our eggs?</Text>
  <Text ID="254538">We need to invest now.</Text>
  <Text ID="254539">Where are the best margins?</Text>
  <Text ID="254540">What's our strategy?</Text>
  <Text ID="254541">I advise you pick on profit.</Text>
  <Text ID="254528">This has to make a splash.</Text>
  <Text ID="254542">It's a phenomenon!</Text>
  <Text ID="254543">The impact of a meteor!</Text>
  <Text ID="254544">Ours will be the biggest and best.</Text>
  <Text ID="254545">The spectacle of the decade!</Text>
  <Text ID="254529">Can't it be faster?</Text>
  <Text ID="254546">I hate waiting when I've spent good money! </Text>
  <Text ID="254547">Surely, but slowly, coming along.</Text>
  <Text ID="254532">Brought to a halt?! Why?</Text>
  <Text ID="254552">What the deuce are you playing at?</Text>
  <Text ID="254553">What planning problems?!</Text>
  <Text ID="254533">I expect return on my investment immediately!</Text>
  <Text ID="254554">My patience is well and truly spent!</Text>
  <Text ID="254555">Tell me why I shouldn't back out of this fiasco?</Text>
  <Text ID="254557">A momentous occasion!</Text>
  <Text ID="254562">The ribbon is cut, they're streaming in!</Text>
  <Text ID="254563">Crowds from far and wide!</Text>
  <Text ID="254564">A milestone in the world of finance.</Text>
  <Text ID="254565">I hereby inaugurate this co-operative!</Text>
  <Text ID="254534">I died of boredom weeks ago, but they haven't!</Text>
  <Text ID="254566">Still good footfall, let it drag on.</Text>
  <Text ID="254567">It's old news now, but they keep on coming.</Text>
  <Text ID="254568">It's a yawn, but we do keep getting more punters.</Text>
  <Text ID="254569">Yes, it's still going!</Text>
  <Text ID="254536">They've had their fun, let's have ours.</Text>
  <Text ID="254571">About time we toasted to profit.</Text>
  <Text ID="254572">Finally it's over! What's do we get? </Text>
  <Text ID="254573">Exhibits under wraps, show me the proceeds!</Text>
  <Text ID="254574">The doors are shut, where are the proceeds?</Text>
  <Text ID="254537">They'd go for a song at auction...</Text>
  <Text ID="254575">My grandchildren always ask for these.</Text>
  <Text ID="254576">Of course, we're all only in it for the rewards.</Text>
  <Text ID="258046">The foremost architects, pillars of civilisation.</Text>
  <Text ID="258047">Grand plans for the grandest of cities.</Text>
  <Text ID="258052">The veneer doesn't seem to be cracking yet!</Text>
  <Text ID="258053">The roof hasn't caved in on it yet!</Text>
  <Text ID="258058">More than flimsy paper sketches, tangible results!</Text>
  <Text ID="258061">All that city planning has paid awf!</Text>
  <Text ID="268070">The wonders of the past, for so long unseen!</Text>
  <Text ID="268071">The World was a different place then.</Text>
  <Text ID="268072">The past is proving fascinating!</Text>
  <Text ID="268073">Time stands still for your visitors it seems!</Text>
  <Text ID="268068">I've a myriad of these laying about.</Text>
  <Text ID="268069">An unwanted christmas gift.</Text>
  <Text ID="268074">Who would want to visit with this mayhem!?</Text>
  <Text ID="268075">This situation is scaring all our patrons away!</Text>
  <Text ID="268076">The fire is putting people off our investment!</Text>
  <Text ID="268077">The fire is reducing footfall!</Text>
  <Text ID="268078">Disease has thinned-out visitor numbers!</Text>
  <Text ID="268079">They all seem too unwell to attend!</Text>
  <Text ID="268080">The riots undermine our attraction!</Text>
  <Text ID="268081">Visitors rightly feel they may be mobbed en route!</Text>
  <Text ID="268082">We cannot open our doors while under attack!</Text>
  <Text ID="268083">There is a war on, people are otherwise occupied!</Text>
  <Text ID="263870">Good, good.</Text>
  <Text ID="263871">Qué bueno!</Text>
  <Text ID="263872">About time it was something good.</Text>
  <Text ID="263873">I'll sing about it.</Text>
  <Text ID="263874">Sí, it's fine.</Text>
  <Text ID="263885">Bien hecho, Good job!</Text>
  <Text ID="263886">You have it in you, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="263887">You give me pride.</Text>
  <Text ID="263888">You know my struggles, boss!</Text>
  <Text ID="263889">Así, that's how it's done!</Text>
  <Text ID="263890">Of course!</Text>
  <Text ID="263891">The things I put up with…</Text>
  <Text ID="263892">Never a breather… </Text>
  <Text ID="263893">Horrible!</Text>
  <Text ID="263894">And this is what I break my back for?</Text>
  <Text ID="263895">How could you?</Text>
  <Text ID="263896">I ask myself if you're up to this.</Text>
  <Text ID="263897">I've lived enough to know your kind…</Text>
  <Text ID="263898">You think you're better than us, don’t you.</Text>
  <Text ID="263899">It's not the time to be playing around.</Text>
  <Text ID="263900">Muchas gracias.</Text>
  <Text ID="263901">I owe you, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="263902">Thank you, honest.</Text>
  <Text ID="263903">I'm already thinking about it.</Text>
  <Text ID="263904">Claro, I will!</Text>
  <Text ID="263905">Give me a few minutes.</Text>
  <Text ID="263906">No!</Text>
  <Text ID="263907">That what you think we're for? </Text>
  <Text ID="263908">Not me!</Text>
  <Text ID="263909">You cannot do my job with soft hands, let me tell you that.</Text>
  <Text ID="263910">I've done my job without hellish máquinas all my life and I'm not changing that now.</Text>
  <Text ID="263911">Kids these days have lost our values.</Text>
  <Text ID="263912">I have things to do.</Text>
  <Text ID="263914">I bet they let máquinas do all the work where you come from. </Text>
  <Text ID="263913">Those spoiled obreros have never seen what real work is like.</Text>
  <Text ID="263915">Youths these days are too lazy to get things done with their own hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="263917">Pinche carts get stuck without roads.</Text>
  <Text ID="263918">Carreteras, boss! Roads!</Text>
  <Text ID="263953">You're not too important to help an old man up a hill?</Text>
  <Text ID="263954">The sun is hot today. I could use a little help.</Text>
  <Text ID="263955">I wouldn't ask if I could do it myself.</Text>
  <Text ID="263956">Help the old man with a hat, por favor?</Text>
  <Text ID="263957">Do this for me, sí? sí?</Text>
  <Text ID="263958">Buena suerte.</Text>
  <Text ID="263959">Good to hear.</Text>
  <Text ID="263960">Gracias, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="263961">Times have changed you know.</Text>
  <Text ID="263962">I see how it is…</Text>
  <Text ID="263963">Meh.</Text>
  <Text ID="263964">No-one keeps their word these days. </Text>
  <Text ID="263965">If I could choose not to do my job...</Text>
  <Text ID="263966">Ya está?</Text>
  <Text ID="263967">Did you finish?</Text>
  <Text ID="263968">Done?</Text>
  <Text ID="263969">I'm feeling really proud.</Text>
  <Text ID="263970">You kept your word. </Text>
  <Text ID="263971">Así se hace, way to go!</Text>
  <Text ID="263972">A little more help?</Text>
  <Text ID="263973">There is another little thing…</Text>
  <Text ID="263975">Always other choosing for you…</Text>
  <Text ID="263976">Don't look at me, is up to you!</Text>
  <Text ID="263977">It's sometimes good to take things slowly.</Text>
  <Text ID="263978">The young people— they always forget.</Text>
  <Text ID="263979">They always leave the seniors for last…</Text>
  <Text ID="263980">Bring back the good old times, Boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="263981">I don't like to ask for más, you've been good to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="263982">There's only a few things I remember were better when I was young…</Text>
  <Text ID="263989">The lord is my shepherd.</Text>
  <Text ID="263990">The grandkids probably hope I drown.</Text>
  <Text ID="263991">Now we get a special treatment. </Text>
  <Text ID="268891">You earned this, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="268892">The familia wanted you to have this.</Text>
  <Text ID="268893">Don't even mention it.</Text>
  <Text ID="263992">Need help with this land, huh? Don't worry, I got this.</Text>
  <Text ID="264010">Rather take my chances in the jungle!</Text>
  <Text ID="264011">Is this how you people think we live?</Text>
  <Text ID="264012">We're no salvajes!</Text>
  <Text ID="264013">As I always say, the world is doomed.</Text>
  <Text ID="264014">This place has gone to the dogs!</Text>
  <Text ID="264015">My grandkids are crying! </Text>
  <Text ID="264016">The whole place stinks!</Text>
  <Text ID="264017">This is not humble, this is poor!</Text>
  <Text ID="264018">Very bad, very very bad.</Text>
  <Text ID="264019">Who would want this for their familia?</Text>
  <Text ID="264020">Barely get by here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264021">Tougher than the old times.</Text>
  <Text ID="264022">My wrinkles are getting deeper.</Text>
  <Text ID="264023">Hard to get up in the mañana.</Text>
  <Text ID="264024">Break your back and get nothing…</Text>
  <Text ID="264025">This is not worth all the hours al sol.</Text>
  <Text ID="264026">Don't let me get started on the conditions here…</Text>
  <Text ID="264027">It's no paraíso for me.</Text>
  <Text ID="264028">A shack and little more.</Text>
  <Text ID="264029">I've never had it easy…</Text>
  <Text ID="264030">I've been through worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="264031">I wouldn't call these lean years.</Text>
  <Text ID="264032">There are a few things to bring up to the patrón.</Text>
  <Text ID="264033">We survive.</Text>
  <Text ID="264034">Mediocre.</Text>
  <Text ID="264035">I'm used to not having much...</Text>
  <Text ID="264036">It's not special here, but what do you expect?</Text>
  <Text ID="264037">I still have a few stories how it used to be better.</Text>
  <Text ID="264038">Not much to really celebrate.</Text>
  <Text ID="264039">We are fine. </Text>
  <Text ID="264040">It's the small things in life.</Text>
  <Text ID="264041">I'm happy when my familia is happy.</Text>
  <Text ID="264042">No bad place to see out the twilight years.</Text>
  <Text ID="264043">La felicidad.</Text>
  <Text ID="264044">Not even my alpaca is complaining.</Text>
  <Text ID="264045">My harmonica never sounded cheerier.</Text>
  <Text ID="264046">My nietos are growing strong!</Text>
  <Text ID="264047">We've been singing every night.</Text>
  <Text ID="264048">Something to keep waking up for.</Text>
  <Text ID="264049">I feel young again.</Text>
  <Text ID="264050">Living a gringo's life!</Text>
  <Text ID="264051">The best years of my life have all come at the end!</Text>
  <Text ID="264052">When my times comes, I'll be turning heaven down!</Text>
  <Text ID="264053">It's a total paraíso!</Text>
  <Text ID="264054">Maybe I'll live forever, eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="264055">Fuego! Fuego!</Text>
  <Text ID="264056">We're beans in the roasting tin!</Text>
  <Text ID="264057">My straw hat caught fire!</Text>
  <Text ID="264058">I caught a bad bicho…</Text>
  <Text ID="264059">Maybe now is the end coming…</Text>
  <Text ID="264060">I hate going to the doctor…</Text>
  <Text ID="264061">We do honest work, give us honest pay!</Text>
  <Text ID="264062">What are you going to eat? Eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="264063">Los ancianos unidos! </Text>
  <Text ID="264073">We stay together.</Text>
  <Text ID="264074">We'll see how you do without us.</Text>
  <Text ID="264075">We have values here!</Text>
  <Text ID="264076">City folk will never understand…</Text>
  <Text ID="264077">You will value our labour!</Text>
  <Text ID="264078">Whoa, Paca! </Text>
  <Text ID="264079">Lunch time so soon?</Text>
  <Text ID="264080">We'll be a la sombra.</Text>
  <Text ID="264081">I'll go grab my hoe…</Text>
  <Text ID="264082">I'll leave my coffee for later.</Text>
  <Text ID="264083">Ok, vamos!</Text>
  <Text ID="264115">Come to watch?</Text>
  <Text ID="264116">Hola!</Text>
  <Text ID="264117">Stay aside, boss, don't get dirt on your fancy shoes.</Text>
  <Text ID="264118">You should go sit in the shade, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="264119">What can I do for you?</Text>
  <Text ID="264120">Working harder and longer.</Text>
  <Text ID="264121">I'm so tired, no puedo más.</Text>
  <Text ID="264122">Before dawn and after dusk.</Text>
  <Text ID="264123">Maybe if I was twenty years younger…</Text>
  <Text ID="264124">My poor back…</Text>
  <Text ID="264130">I don't really know what to do after work.</Text>
  <Text ID="264131">Hours stretch en mi casa.</Text>
  <Text ID="264132">I'll have to learn more songs on my harmonica…</Text>
  <Text ID="264133">Pastimes get boring at my age…</Text>
  <Text ID="264134">You and your modern ideas… </Text>
  <Text ID="264138">Save what you can!</Text>
  <Text ID="264139">Too toasted for my taste! </Text>
  <Text ID="264140">If this passes on it's on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="264141">Is it hotter than usual…?</Text>
  <Text ID="264142">Played all the rancheras I know…</Text>
  <Text ID="264143">Still don't need us?</Text>
  <Text ID="264147">It just doesn't grow here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264148">Never had those here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264149">The land has to be prepared first.</Text>
  <Text ID="264150">No fields, no work.</Text>
  <Text ID="264151">I'm my times we had more help.</Text>
  <Text ID="264152">We're not going far without more hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="264153">Still waiting for it to arrive.</Text>
  <Text ID="264154">If they don't bring some first…</Text>
  <Text ID="264155">There's nowhere to take it.</Text>
  <Text ID="264156">But where to?</Text>
  <Text ID="264157">No more space here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264158">Storeroom's full, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="264159">It's coming out of our ears.</Text>
  <Text ID="264160">All full. Everywhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="264161">You got me working, I'll play for you later.</Text>
  <Text ID="264162">When it comes to experience, I can't be beaten.</Text>
  <Text ID="264163">If there is going to be a war I'm heading for the hills.</Text>
  <Text ID="264164">I already had my share of fighting.</Text>
  <Text ID="264165">Just hold them off, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="264166">In war, don't finish second. </Text>
  <Text ID="264167">Think I've never seen a war?</Text>
  <Text ID="264168">Thought you wanted me to volunteer for a little momento. </Text>
  <Text ID="264174">Never go out without a fight.</Text>
  <Text ID="264175">Let them come, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="264176">They can't scare an old man.</Text>
  <Text ID="264179">Hate to say this, but we need power.</Text>
  <Text ID="264180">It's not plugged, boss.</Text>
  <Text ID="264181">Doesn’t work without your modern thingy.</Text>
  <Text ID="266146">Is not my fault, eh!</Text>
  <Text ID="266147">Not enough, ya sé.</Text>
  <Text ID="266148">One of the worst years I can remember.</Text>
  <Text ID="266149">Something's gone wrong!</Text>
  <Text ID="266150">Believe me, we're trying.</Text>
  <Text ID="266183">The earth has given up on us.</Text>
  <Text ID="266184">It's looking pretty slim.</Text>
  <Text ID="266404">With that first bang I knew it was you! So come show me what you got this time!</Text>
  <Text ID="266405">Ah! That burnt reek! Ugh! Hand over whatever it is and I'll help you get rid of it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266406">Here are your tickets. Hurry, drifters! The boat is leaving soon. And nobody wants you to miss it.</Text>
  <Text ID="266407">Fuera! I told you drifters before, rum don’t grow on trees.</Text>
  <Text ID="266408">When are you layabouts going to get a job?</Text>
  <Text ID="266409">What the chimichurri was that boom?</Text>
  <Text ID="266410">So maldito loud the church bell is ringing!</Text>
  <Text ID="267932">Please, we are slaves! Do not return us to those demons!</Text>
  <Text ID="267933">Is it really safe here? If I see another Pyrphorian it will be too soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="267934">I was very sick, before this divine intervention!</Text>
  <Text ID="263875">I dreamed of this!</Text>
  <Text ID="263876">I hope it stays like this. </Text>
  <Text ID="263877">Makes me want to keep striving.</Text>
  <Text ID="263878">What we always aspired to! </Text>
  <Text ID="263879">I always believed.</Text>
  <Text ID="263919">It's all thanks to your leadership!</Text>
  <Text ID="263920">You guide us towards something bright!</Text>
  <Text ID="263921">You are a true revolutionary!</Text>
  <Text ID="263922">We will always follow you!</Text>
  <Text ID="263923">We have to thank you for it!</Text>
  <Text ID="263924">My dreams are crushed.</Text>
  <Text ID="263925">I refuse to accept it.</Text>
  <Text ID="263926">We will not surrender to this.</Text>
  <Text ID="263927">What an ugly prospect…</Text>
  <Text ID="263928">I'm not settling for this.</Text>
  <Text ID="263929">You bring a blight on us.</Text>
  <Text ID="263930">Please, no more empty promises.</Text>
  <Text ID="263931">Just another despot…</Text>
  <Text ID="263932">Where is the progress we crave?</Text>
  <Text ID="263933">You have a responsibility to help us!</Text>
  <Text ID="263934">I'm thankful for what you've achieved.</Text>
  <Text ID="263935">We will remember your actions.</Text>
  <Text ID="263936">Much obliged. </Text>
  <Text ID="263937">We are ready and strong!</Text>
  <Text ID="263938">We will!</Text>
  <Text ID="263939">I don't see why not! </Text>
  <Text ID="263940">No!</Text>
  <Text ID="263941">Impossible!</Text>
  <Text ID="263942">I cannot, I will not!</Text>
  <Text ID="263943">In the old days, my voice would not have been heard.</Text>
  <Text ID="263944">I owe my independence to the revolution.</Text>
  <Text ID="263945">I can't even dream what is yet to come!</Text>
  <Text ID="263946">In these modern times, I can become whoever I want to be.</Text>
  <Text ID="263948">I wish I could see your great cities in the Old World!</Text>
  <Text ID="263949">Do your people believe we are a backward society…?</Text>
  <Text ID="263950">I will continue to strive for everyone's freedom!</Text>
  <Text ID="263947">I feel bad for the poor jornaleros, they will never experience the bliss that comes with progress.</Text>
  <Text ID="263951">We are isolated!</Text>
  <Text ID="263952">We have no path to follow.</Text>
  <Text ID="264182">Could you light our path once more?</Text>
  <Text ID="264183">I'm sure there is a way you can help us thrive.</Text>
  <Text ID="264184">I believe you will solve this problem.</Text>
  <Text ID="264185">I would appreciate your help.</Text>
  <Text ID="264186">This will bring us closer to the dream.</Text>
  <Text ID="264187">You honour us again.</Text>
  <Text ID="264188">I knew you wouldn't turn on us.</Text>
  <Text ID="264189">We trust you.</Text>
  <Text ID="264190">I shouldn't have asked so much... </Text>
  <Text ID="264191">I'm sure it'll be better next time.</Text>
  <Text ID="264192">It would have been nice… </Text>
  <Text ID="264193">Oh…! Ok… </Text>
  <Text ID="264194">Then you've done nothing…?</Text>
  <Text ID="264195">Really? So soon?</Text>
  <Text ID="264196">It is done? </Text>
  <Text ID="264197">You didn't slack beneath the palmtrees!</Text>
  <Text ID="264198">You never let me down!</Text>
  <Text ID="264199">Of course you could do it!</Text>
  <Text ID="264200">You're faster than the old Jornalero!</Text>
  <Text ID="264201">There is another matter you could help with.</Text>
  <Text ID="264202">Do you still have time to spare?</Text>
  <Text ID="264204">I know you trust us like we trust you.</Text>
  <Text ID="264205">I have faith you will see the right path.</Text>
  <Text ID="264206">Have you had a chance…?</Text>
  <Text ID="264207">I'm still dreaming of better.</Text>
  <Text ID="264208">When will you have time...?</Text>
  <Text ID="264209">Here's a revolutionary new idea…</Text>
  <Text ID="264210">Life is great here. We can set an example!</Text>
  <Text ID="264211">If we reach the top, the world will follow!</Text>
  <Text ID="264218">Our new ideas create many enemies…!</Text>
  <Text ID="264219">Better safe than sorry?</Text>
  <Text ID="264220">There's still violence in this world… </Text>
  <Text ID="268894">A memento of this incredible time!</Text>
  <Text ID="268895">No other deserves this gift.</Text>
  <Text ID="268896">Let this gift be a reminder in a thousand years!</Text>
  <Text ID="264221">We will help you build something better!</Text>
  <Text ID="264239">Not what I signed up for!</Text>
  <Text ID="264240">Everything is going backwards!</Text>
  <Text ID="264241">We're free to be miserable!</Text>
  <Text ID="264242">My dreams —turned to nightmares!</Text>
  <Text ID="264243">It was better under La Corona!</Text>
  <Text ID="264244">I will not be subjected to criminal abuse!</Text>
  <Text ID="264245">These are no conditions to live!</Text>
  <Text ID="264246">Have we learned nothing from the past?</Text>
  <Text ID="264247">What a twisted mess!</Text>
  <Text ID="264248">There is no future here!</Text>
  <Text ID="264249">I can feel my spirit being drained…</Text>
  <Text ID="264250">I only hope it won't get worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="264251">Why keep striving…?</Text>
  <Text ID="264252">The dream seems so far away...</Text>
  <Text ID="264253">This is the life we wanted to forget!</Text>
  <Text ID="264254">We don't have the basics!</Text>
  <Text ID="264255">Every day a step back. </Text>
  <Text ID="264256">It's not a blue sky for me….</Text>
  <Text ID="264257">I don't see a future… </Text>
  <Text ID="264258">All my hope and effort, for this… </Text>
  <Text ID="264259">I'm sure there's more we can do!</Text>
  <Text ID="264260">We are halfway there!</Text>
  <Text ID="264261">Still a long way to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="264262">I wouldn't be a rebel if I settled for this! </Text>
  <Text ID="264263">We could become a landmark!</Text>
  <Text ID="264264">We're not there yet…!</Text>
  <Text ID="264265">We're on the right track.</Text>
  <Text ID="264266">Why survive when we can thrive!</Text>
  <Text ID="264267">We could be better, I'm sure of it!</Text>
  <Text ID="264268">With just a bit more heart…</Text>
  <Text ID="264269">I'm proud of how far we've come.</Text>
  <Text ID="264270">I knew we could make it!</Text>
  <Text ID="264271">So gratifying living here!</Text>
  <Text ID="264272">It's exactly like I imagined!</Text>
  <Text ID="264273">Revolution bore fruit!</Text>
  <Text ID="264274">I feel so lucky!</Text>
  <Text ID="264275">We are the future!</Text>
  <Text ID="264276">Our grandmothers would have never believed this.</Text>
  <Text ID="264277">We put our hopes in the right place.</Text>
  <Text ID="264278">This place is full of spirit!</Text>
  <Text ID="264279">The dream, this land, is real!</Text>
  <Text ID="264280">We're centuries ahead of our time!</Text>
  <Text ID="264281">If we could spread this way of life to the whole world…! </Text>
  <Text ID="264282">Finally a place worth striving for!</Text>
  <Text ID="264283">I will wave our flag with pride!</Text>
  <Text ID="264284">Fires of passion!</Text>
  <Text ID="264285">Fuego! Help!</Text>
  <Text ID="264286">Put it out, put it out!</Text>
  <Text ID="264287">My spirit is weak…</Text>
  <Text ID="264288">We are very sick!</Text>
  <Text ID="264289">We look to a cure!</Text>
  <Text ID="264290">Long live the revolution!</Text>
  <Text ID="264291">We will not let our rights be stomped!</Text>
  <Text ID="264292">We stand up to abuse!</Text>
  <Text ID="264302">This is the path of passive resistance!</Text>
  <Text ID="264303">We've organised a picket!</Text>
  <Text ID="264304">No activity from us activists!</Text>
  <Text ID="264305">We are not your minions!</Text>
  <Text ID="264306">Expect nothing any time soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="264307">Go back to your families.</Text>
  <Text ID="264308">Stop production!</Text>
  <Text ID="264309">No more work for now!</Text>
  <Text ID="264310">Back to the future!</Text>
  <Text ID="264311">I can start singing again!</Text>
  <Text ID="264312">Return to your posts!</Text>
  <Text ID="264344">Wise to take time to learn the nuances!</Text>
  <Text ID="264345">I can teach you how it works?</Text>
  <Text ID="264346">Of course, come join us!</Text>
  <Text ID="264347">The more the merrier!</Text>
  <Text ID="264348">What brings you here, governor?</Text>
  <Text ID="264349">Trying to make the best of the situation…</Text>
  <Text ID="264350">Quality isn't quantity.</Text>
  <Text ID="264351">I believed we would be independent.</Text>
  <Text ID="264352">I miss my family… </Text>
  <Text ID="264353">I am losing my enthusiasm.</Text>
  <Text ID="264359">Ideal conditions!</Text>
  <Text ID="264360">Time to develop my passions!</Text>
  <Text ID="264361">A modern-thinking governor!</Text>
  <Text ID="264362">I can't wait to start work every morning!</Text>
  <Text ID="264363">I am so motivated!</Text>
  <Text ID="264367">Our hopes are turning to ash!</Text>
  <Text ID="264368">Everything we worked for, up in smoke! </Text>
  <Text ID="264369">A great sickness is spreading…! </Text>
  <Text ID="264370">The fruit of labour is tainted…!</Text>
  <Text ID="264371">We are keen to get started again.</Text>
  <Text ID="264372">We cannot catch the future standing still… </Text>
  <Text ID="264376">The fertility is missing.</Text>
  <Text ID="264377">We can't get that here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264378">We lack the means of production!</Text>
  <Text ID="264379">What about workshops?</Text>
  <Text ID="264380">We need more workers!</Text>
  <Text ID="264381">Gather more people!</Text>
  <Text ID="264382">We need raw materials!</Text>
  <Text ID="264383">There must be input for output!</Text>
  <Text ID="264384">These must be stored somewhere.</Text>
  <Text ID="264385">If there's no place we can take it to… </Text>
  <Text ID="264386">We're up to our eyebrows!</Text>
  <Text ID="264387">We are out of room!</Text>
  <Text ID="264390">We are ordinary workers, but in it together.</Text>
  <Text ID="264391">Change begins here. Let's roll up our sleeves and make a difference.</Text>
  <Text ID="264392">I hope you fight for our rights.</Text>
  <Text ID="264393">I don't usually approve of violence, but… </Text>
  <Text ID="264394">Sometimes we need to take action.</Text>
  <Text ID="264395">We should try to win hastily!</Text>
  <Text ID="264396">Our enemies are the tyrants…!</Text>
  <Text ID="264397">We shall prevail for greater good!</Text>
  <Text ID="264403">Could they break our spirit…?</Text>
  <Text ID="264404">They have no scruples!</Text>
  <Text ID="264405">Our future is threatened!</Text>
  <Text ID="264408">We require electrical power!</Text>
  <Text ID="264409">The dream depends on electricity!</Text>
  <Text ID="264410">We need to feel connected!</Text>
  <Text ID="266111">We are failing!</Text>
  <Text ID="266112">Change is very slow!</Text>
  <Text ID="266113">We are trying our hardest!</Text>
  <Text ID="266114">It's a real struggle… </Text>
  <Text ID="266115">We are empty-handed!</Text>
  <Text ID="266116">Nowhere near our goal.</Text>
  <Text ID="266117">We have fallen far behind.</Text>
  <Text ID="267966">I know we can build a future here!</Text>
  <Text ID="267969">Help they have found us!</Text>
  <Text ID="264985">Samuel's child, is it? Thank Heavens! I am so ashamed of every single word your uncle had me print.</Text>
  <Text ID="266541">I feel as crushed and obsolete as yesterday's front page.</Text>
  <Text ID="266542">Nothing I say has any influence on Edvard, I am his doormat.</Text>
  <Text ID="265029">If you pick me, you may have my boat! It's my poor aunt's legacy. Her second husband was a decent sailor.</Text>
  <Text ID="265030">Everybody on board? Good! I shiver at the thought of staying here another second…</Text>
  <Text ID="265031">Our city's historic first shipyard! We must document this moment in our first edition!</Text>
  <Text ID="265032">The perfect snapshot to illustrate  history-in-the-making!</Text>
  <Text ID="265043">The start of, if I dare presume, a most fruitful partnership!</Text>
  <Text ID="265033">With several passionate young reporters enlisted, our publishing house is already well-underway!</Text>
  <Text ID="265034">Our editorial section is sure to grow along with your city. We are fine-tuning the first issue as we speak!</Text>
  <Text ID="266759">I know, it's not much of a ship, but this is not the time to be picky.</Text>
  <Text ID="267898">Destructive can be constructive…</Text>
  <Text ID="267900">We'll blast the competition out of the water!</Text>
  <Text ID="265499">A special edition for a special happening - this makes everybody happy.</Text>
  <Text ID="266719">And if I may—excuse me—a false one. We left Edvard quite willingly.</Text>
  <Text ID="266726">Indeed! Once my letterpress is up and running, the truth will come back to haunt Edvard! For your hospitality, please, use my ship howsoever you may wish!</Text>
  <Text ID="253635">To meet our patron, is utterly humbling, if there is anything I can do, anything really, imagine it, and we can do it.</Text>
  <Text ID="253636">Really, entirely marvellous to meet you, and that we may show truth, or anything actually, in my—our broadsheet. </Text>
  <Text ID="253638">Boot doesn't, indeed, taste half as bad as they say.</Text>
  <Text ID="253639">We have taken to calling you 'the master' among many other complimentary monikers.</Text>
  <Text ID="253640">Do I catch you in especially good humour, governor? </Text>
  <Text ID="253641">You look as radiant as ever.</Text>
  <Text ID="253642">Oh, impeccable timing as always.</Text>
  <Text ID="260369">Can I interest you in this recently-polished apple?</Text>
  <Text ID="260370">The idiot is back. Oh heavens I...I thought you were the photographer. </Text>
  <Text ID="253599">Famous! Famous!</Text>
  <Text ID="253606">It can only increase readership!</Text>
  <Text ID="253607">Not good news, great news!</Text>
  <Text ID="253608">All the best news never sees print!</Text>
  <Text ID="253609">Circulation is recovering.</Text>
  <Text ID="260317">A sensation!</Text>
  <Text ID="260318">Everything seems up-to-the-minute!</Text>
  <Text ID="253610">This is tremendous exposure.</Text>
  <Text ID="253625">You never disappoint!</Text>
  <Text ID="253626">You are the paradigm!</Text>
  <Text ID="260320">I would lick spittle for you, governor.</Text>
  <Text ID="260321">You teach us endlessly.</Text>
  <Text ID="260322">In the headlines for all the right reasons.</Text>
  <Text ID="260323">You are more than a silent observer.</Text>
  <Text ID="253627">If I can't spin this, nobody can.</Text>
  <Text ID="253628">A crisis! No other way of looking at it!</Text>
  <Text ID="253629">No such thing as bad publicity...</Text>
  <Text ID="253630">Changes do make things difficult.</Text>
  <Text ID="253631">Still just about clinging on...</Text>
  <Text ID="260324">A scandal!</Text>
  <Text ID="260325">Black, white, and red all over!</Text>
  <Text ID="253632">I understand...</Text>
  <Text ID="253633">Don't worry, I'm still hanging on.</Text>
  <Text ID="253634">Sincerely glad, to be tarred with the same brush.</Text>
  <Text ID="260326">No, drag me through the mud. </Text>
  <Text ID="260327">Nothing will make me leave your side.</Text>
  <Text ID="260328">You do keep us on our toes...</Text>
  <Text ID="260329">Ignore my miserable-type face.</Text>
  <Text ID="253643">An extraordinary act of kindness, and if there is any way I might dare to repay this magnanimous act of beneficience... </Text>
  <Text ID="253644">What? Er...thank you!</Text>
  <Text ID="253645">The offices here are really on their feet, astonished by the compassion shown for our small, unimportant little print family...</Text>
  <Text ID="253648">Right away!</Text>
  <Text ID="253649">On it as we speak!</Text>
  <Text ID="253650">Readily, readily!</Text>
  <Text ID="253651">I can't...</Text>
  <Text ID="253652">Even I wouldn't stoop that low...</Text>
  <Text ID="260398">I beg you, no.</Text>
  <Text ID="253654">In journalism, one holds a mirror to life, amplifies the voiceless, pursues truth. In newspapers, you do what you're told.</Text>
  <Text ID="253655">I cannot thank you enough for saving our publishing house! Quite the windfall after being cut loose from our angered— I mean elderly, stakeholders.</Text>
  <Text ID="253656">I once went undercover as a clown, and joined the circus! But when the balloon burst, my report was far too colourful to publish.</Text>
  <Text ID="253657">Printed news ever die out? Why should it?  Not an inclination of yours is it? </Text>
  <Text ID="253658">My first tip-off was a riot at a mill. I got to the picket line, only to take a stone to the head. When I came to, everyone and my story had vanished. </Text>
  <Text ID="260401">I'm really much better at self-editing on paper... </Text>
  <Text ID="252266">It's all prepared.</Text>
  <Text ID="252267">A check copy?</Text>
  <Text ID="252268">I feel it reflects the times. </Text>
  <Text ID="252269">I'm confident it's ready to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="252270">I could simply go to press?</Text>
  <Text ID="252271">One final look?</Text>
  <Text ID="252272">Not too many changes, I hope?</Text>
  <Text ID="253659">A special edition!</Text>
  <Text ID="253660">One headline dominates the front pages.</Text>
  <Text ID="253661">Extra, extra!</Text>
  <Text ID="260477">An overwhelmingly positive edition!</Text>
  <Text ID="260488">A glowing review, absolutely no need to change it!</Text>
  <Text ID="260489">Ah! Good news!</Text>
  <Text ID="260490">We could hardly dig anything up! A-haha.</Text>
  <Text ID="260491">Your conscience must be spotless! </Text>
  <Text ID="260492">You'll want to leave this one as it is, won't you?</Text>
  <Text ID="260493">Too harsh?</Text>
  <Text ID="260494">Does it go too far?</Text>
  <Text ID="260495">It's as kind as we could make it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260496">I tried sweetening it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260497">We all have to swallow bitter pills sometimes.</Text>
  <Text ID="260498">We have done our best.</Text>
  <Text ID="253664">It's out!</Text>
  <Text ID="253665">Can't stop it now!</Text>
  <Text ID="253666">On every street corner in no time!</Text>
  <Text ID="253667">They'll be choking over their breakfasts!</Text>
  <Text ID="252273">It's out of my hands now...</Text>
  <Text ID="252274">We had to go to press...</Text>
  <Text ID="252275">I wouldn't worry, most only look at the pictures.</Text>
  <Text ID="252276">Uncompromising journalism!</Text>
  <Text ID="252277">No changes? Really?!</Text>
  <Text ID="252278">It's important to be true to oneself.</Text>
  <Text ID="252279">Censorship is not always the cranny of the corrupt! </Text>
  <Text ID="252280">Of course, you know what's best.</Text>
  <Text ID="252281">Anything else? Then I'll send it out.</Text>
  <Text ID="260519">Are you sur— Of course you're sure.</Text>
  <Text ID="260520">Mum's the word. </Text>
  <Text ID="260521">I'm certain they won't read between the lines.</Text>
  <Text ID="260522">Call it a white lie.</Text>
  <Text ID="260523">The subtext is totally imperceptible.</Text>
  <Text ID="260524">Poetic licence.</Text>
  <Text ID="260525">It took minimal revision.</Text>
  <Text ID="260526">Something like this?</Text>
  <Text ID="260530">After all, papers are for drumming-up support.</Text>
  <Text ID="260535">Sound the trumpets!</Text>
  <Text ID="260536">You are always uniquely diplomatic.</Text>
  <Text ID="260537">We will all be absolutely behind you.</Text>
  <Text ID="260531">You certainly have us by the leash! </Text>
  <Text ID="260538">Nobody would dare challenge your authority!</Text>
  <Text ID="260539">Frightening stuff!</Text>
  <Text ID="260540">You won't hear a peep from me. </Text>
  <Text ID="260532">It is possible to survive on scraps. </Text>
  <Text ID="260544">It can only do them good, I'm sure.</Text>
  <Text ID="260545">Austerity, very wise.</Text>
  <Text ID="260546">I don't think it too severe, not at all.</Text>
  <Text ID="260533">Diverting.</Text>
  <Text ID="260547">Sometimes nice to have tangential news.</Text>
  <Text ID="260548">I don't think it's misleading.</Text>
  <Text ID="260549">There may be the odd unchecked fact.</Text>
  <Text ID="260550">Should keep them flicking through pages.</Text>
  <Text ID="260551">That should draw attention away from...hm.</Text>
  <Text ID="260534">What glad news.</Text>
  <Text ID="260558">It's important to be happy.</Text>
  <Text ID="260559">I think they'll swallow it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260560">It's a different perspective.</Text>
  <Text ID="253682">Back to the drawing board? But of course!</Text>
  <Text ID="253683">I'll rearrange the articles in no time.</Text>
  <Text ID="253684">From … scratch? Just a moment!</Text>
  <Text ID="253685">I'm no stranger to starting over!</Text>
  <Text ID="253686">You want the original pieces? Gladly!</Text>
  <Text ID="253675">As you wish, it'll be changed momentarily, of course, absolutely…</Text>
  <Text ID="253676">But you can't just- I mean, you can't leave it unedited, of course!</Text>
  <Text ID="253677">I can't believe- … that I did not think of this sooner!</Text>
  <Text ID="253678">That- that is ... a wonderful idea!</Text>
  <Text ID="253679">This change is absolutely … marvellous, yes!</Text>
  <Text ID="253680">My publishing house- I mean, I am so grateful to work in your publishing house!</Text>
  <Text ID="253681">You know what's best for the readers, after all…</Text>
  <Text ID="253668">If you think this is best, who am I to protest.</Text>
  <Text ID="253669">I suppose it can be reworded like this!</Text>
  <Text ID="253670">Surley these are alternative facts that I'm not privy to.</Text>
  <Text ID="253671">This is certainly a perspective to consider.</Text>
  <Text ID="253672">Some would call it misleading, but you know what's best!</Text>
  <Text ID="253673">If you insist, I … I won't stand in your way.</Text>
  <Text ID="253674">It's no problem, our typesetter will be here all night!</Text>
  <Text ID="260096">What luxury!</Text>
  <Text ID="260097">Most cordial!</Text>
  <Text ID="260098">We feel most welcome</Text>
  <Text ID="260099">What a breath of fresh air.</Text>
  <Text ID="260100">How agreeable.</Text>
  <Text ID="260101">You inspire something in me.</Text>
  <Text ID="260102">Courteous from the moment we arrived. </Text>
  <Text ID="260103">Aren't you most accomodating.</Text>
  <Text ID="260104">You make for a charming host.</Text>
  <Text ID="260105">People must look up to you greatly.</Text>
  <Text ID="260106">This is not what was promised.</Text>
  <Text ID="260107">This is not as advertised!</Text>
  <Text ID="260108">The brochure was misleading!</Text>
  <Text ID="260109">We paid an awful lot to come here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260110">I may just catch the next boat home.</Text>
  <Text ID="260111">What a way for you to treat a guest.</Text>
  <Text ID="260112">You are a monstrous host.</Text>
  <Text ID="260113">Are you the manager?!</Text>
  <Text ID="260114">Are you responsible for this predicament?</Text>
  <Text ID="260115">You make things extraordinarily inconvenient!</Text>
  <Text ID="260116">I've finally arrived! Now to see if the journey was worth it.</Text>
  <Text ID="260117">Finally terra firma! I cannot wait to look around and explore.</Text>
  <Text ID="260118">Lovely day for seafront perambulation!</Text>
  <Text ID="260119">I'm writing a postcard - Ahem - just need someone to deliver it?</Text>
  <Text ID="260120">My portmanteau has spilled out everywhere!</Text>
  <Text ID="260121">Oh! Do you have a luncheon recommendation?</Text>
  <Text ID="260122">Good thing you caught me, we are about to take tea!</Text>
  <Text ID="260128">And at no additional cost?</Text>
  <Text ID="260129">What an unexpected treat!</Text>
  <Text ID="260130">Oh, much obliged!</Text>
  <Text ID="260131">When in Rome!</Text>
  <Text ID="260132">Happy to take that route.</Text>
  <Text ID="260133">Just the ticket!</Text>
  <Text ID="260139">Putting the first foot out of the door was the best decision I've ever made.</Text>
  <Text ID="260140">With so much out there to see, one has little time for homesickness, though I do keep pictures in my locket.</Text>
  <Text ID="260141">Certain gentlemen might recoil seeing ladies travel alone, but that is well, if recoiled they remain. </Text>
  <Text ID="260142">I notice that from altitude, it appears rather like an immense toy city! </Text>
  <Text ID="260143">Were the world a book, most wouldn't pass the foreword. Shame, because chapter one is just about the juiciest.</Text>
  <Text ID="260144">How about a parambrella, for rain or shine? Goodness knows how I could use such a thing. </Text>
  <Text ID="260148">We have a very fixed itinerary.</Text>
  <Text ID="260149">That's not in the handbook!</Text>
  <Text ID="260150">I won't be led from the beaten path!</Text>
  <Text ID="260254">How peculiar to insist we wait at port. Is something the matter?</Text>
  <Text ID="260269">This city is a magnet for genius.</Text>
  <Text ID="260270">We're in the presence of a virtuoso!</Text>
  <Text ID="260271">How thrilling! A renowned personage has arrived!</Text>
  <Text ID="260284">The secret may be out about this place.</Text>
  <Text ID="260290">A surge of interest here this season.</Text>
  <Text ID="260291">Always hard to keep places under one's hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="260292">An ever-more popular site for we pilgrims.</Text>
  <Text ID="260293">Coming into fashion as a destination.</Text>
  <Text ID="260294">Where interest wanes, there will be a reason.</Text>
  <Text ID="260295">Numbers seem to have dropped off.</Text>
  <Text ID="260296">Perhaps they're going to prettier places.</Text>
  <Text ID="260297">That there are fewer of us should tell you something.</Text>
  <Text ID="260298">Visitors are falling away.</Text>
  <Text ID="260299">No more or less popular than before.</Text>
  <Text ID="260300">Our cruise was just as full as last time.</Text>
  <Text ID="260301">I'm glad, at least, it is not any busier. </Text>
  <Text ID="260302">I see the same faces whenever I come here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260303">Same old holiday gang as last time.</Text>
  <Text ID="260319">Oh to exit these rat tubes!</Text>
  <Text ID="260340">We've been lured to a vile shanty-town! </Text>
  <Text ID="260341">I'd rather stand behind an elephant than ever return!</Text>
  <Text ID="260342">I will see these slums in my nightmares.</Text>
  <Text ID="260343">This city is a house of horrors!</Text>
  <Text ID="260344">A bit municipal isn't it? </Text>
  <Text ID="260349">It's peculiar here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260350">What do I see here? Little piles of dog lime.</Text>
  <Text ID="260351">This might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip. </Text>
  <Text ID="260352">As a centre, it is the palest shade of mediocre.</Text>
  <Text ID="260345">It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.</Text>
  <Text ID="260353">Pleasant, despite the odd pickpocket.</Text>
  <Text ID="260354">I think we've seen everything there is to see. </Text>
  <Text ID="260355">Good, but nothing to write home about.</Text>
  <Text ID="260356">It's nice, though the sand is too yellow.</Text>
  <Text ID="260346">It's everything they said it would be.</Text>
  <Text ID="260357">There's a satisfying amount to enjoy.</Text>
  <Text ID="260358">My impression is in the main, positive.</Text>
  <Text ID="260359">The streets and buildings are arranged nicely.</Text>
  <Text ID="260360">I have no regrets about coming here.</Text>
  <Text ID="260347">I shall remember these fine edifices for some time.</Text>
  <Text ID="260361">One wonders at the genius who built all this.</Text>
  <Text ID="260362">What romance dwells in these streets!</Text>
  <Text ID="260363">It is no façade, the charms of this city are real!</Text>
  <Text ID="260364">So many magnificent vistas, I've lost count.</Text>
  <Text ID="260348">I'm in love with this living watercolour!</Text>
  <Text ID="260365">A paradise! The pleasantest conceivable bubble!</Text>
  <Text ID="260366">Coming here has changed my life forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="260367">A city of angels, streets paved with gold!</Text>
  <Text ID="260368">Please tell me this visit shall never be over!</Text>
  <Text ID="260395">The first? Ooh, am I to receive a prize?</Text>
  <Text ID="260396">I could be the first to bring a new gem to light!</Text>
  <Text ID="260397">Do I have the whole place to myself!?</Text>
  <Text ID="260399">Surely you don't expect us to wade ashore?</Text>
  <Text ID="260400">Where is the welcome party?</Text>
  <Text ID="260422">We're out of things to do but wait for the ferry. </Text>
  <Text ID="260423">We're bored now, so we're leaving.</Text>
  <Text ID="260402">We'll come flooding in now, I'm sure. </Text>
  <Text ID="260403">A gateway to imagination!</Text>
  <Text ID="253874">Ship-shape!</Text>
  <Text ID="253875">Aye, 'tis fair.</Text>
  <Text ID="253876">On course!</Text>
  <Text ID="253877">I'll never get sea-sick!</Text>
  <Text ID="253878">No bitter end in sight!</Text>
  <Text ID="259909">Yer a canny herring!</Text>
  <Text ID="259910">Yer know the ropes!</Text>
  <Text ID="259911">The crew come 'round to you.</Text>
  <Text ID="259912">Kelpie-blood in yer veins!</Text>
  <Text ID="259913">I know a sea-soul when I see one!</Text>
  <Text ID="259914">All at sea!</Text>
  <Text ID="259915">Years at sea, never sank this low.</Text>
  <Text ID="259916">May as well be sunk!</Text>
  <Text ID="259917">A most uneven keel!</Text>
  <Text ID="259918">The worst things happen at sea!</Text>
  <Text ID="259919">Yer aff yer head!</Text>
  <Text ID="259920">Drag us down with yer, eh?!</Text>
  <Text ID="259921">You'd have us piss in the wind!</Text>
  <Text ID="259922">You seem a loose cannon.</Text>
  <Text ID="259923">I won't say "mutiny", Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="259924">I'll steer ye from here to the precipice, the edge of the world!</Text>
  <Text ID="259925">I'll cap'n for ye, til blood boil or freeze in my veins.</Text>
  <Text ID="253800">It's not rainin' unless it makes yer head bleed!</Text>
  <Text ID="253801">We can hope for fair winds, nothing more.</Text>
  <Text ID="253802">This the eye of the devil storm to come!</Text>
  <Text ID="253803">Good captains respect the sea, fear it.</Text>
  <Text ID="253804">Don't come with doubts; too many lie out there.</Text>
  <Text ID="259965">Where are my charts?</Text>
  <Text ID="259966">Preparation!</Text>
  <Text ID="259967">It's sextant time.</Text>
  <Text ID="259968">Let's extend the old telescope.</Text>
  <Text ID="259969">Time to rummage in the old sea chest.</Text>
  <Text ID="259970">Thank the Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="259971">Takes a lot to sway an old dog. </Text>
  <Text ID="259972">Me heart swells like the surf.</Text>
  <Text ID="259973">Aye, aye!</Text>
  <Text ID="259974">If the Admiral commands it!</Text>
  <Text ID="259975">Full steam ahead.</Text>
  <Text ID="259976">So be it!</Text>
  <Text ID="259977">Make it so!</Text>
  <Text ID="259978">As sure as the tide.</Text>
  <Text ID="259979">We do as commanded.</Text>
  <Text ID="259980">That we shall!</Text>
  <Text ID="253805">Freshwater babes know that rivers are but tentacles of the god that is the sea.</Text>
  <Text ID="253806">I've given up my pipe - don't want a dead man's chest!</Text>
  <Text ID="253807">A good seaman is known in bad weather.</Text>
  <Text ID="253808">Ah, the time we pitchpoled in hard wind. There's little left to fear once yer longboat goes end-over-end.</Text>
  <Text ID="253809">What's on land is for land folk, what's at sea is my business.</Text>
  <Text ID="253810">Borne by the waves, die by the waves.</Text>
  <Text ID="253812">Better give Anne Harlow and her ring-eared rats a wide berth, or you'll soon see the ocean bottom.</Text>
  <Text ID="253813">Sir Archibald asks a lot of ordinary folk, to give their lives to the sea and its whiles, but they won't bite off the hand that feeds.</Text>
  <Text ID="253814">Jean LaFortune deserves a reputation. He lost me a finger at the knuckle in a round of gin rummy... </Text>
  <Text ID="259981">Nay, I cannae!</Text>
  <Text ID="259982">Enough, no more!</Text>
  <Text ID="259983">Damned if I will!</Text>
  <Text ID="253797">A bold new expedition, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="253798">Seductive charts bury my desk!</Text>
  <Text ID="253799">These fabled lands exist after all!</Text>
  <Text ID="253840">To the edge of the world!</Text>
  <Text ID="253841">How we've longed to get back to the blue.</Text>
  <Text ID="253842">May we see these shores again.</Text>
  <Text ID="253843">Untold perils await us!</Text>
  <Text ID="253844">We have the devil to pay.</Text>
  <Text ID="253845">Admiral, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="253846">All hands at the ready!</Text>
  <Text ID="253847">We careen into the unknown!</Text>
  <Text ID="253848">We need you, Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="253849">Please, light our way!</Text>
  <Text ID="253850">Shed light in the deeps!</Text>
  <Text ID="255736">We await yer order!</Text>
  <Text ID="255737">Steady her, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="255738">Keep even, our keel!</Text>
  <Text ID="255739">Rope us in, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="255740">Be our anchor!</Text>
  <Text ID="255741">Help us, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="255742">Be our guide!</Text>
  <Text ID="255743">We need a rudder!</Text>
  <Text ID="255744">Bring us home safe!</Text>
  <Text ID="255745">Soothe our doubts!</Text>
  <Text ID="253851">Worth eating biscuit for!</Text>
  <Text ID="253852">Yarr booty!</Text>
  <Text ID="253853">Look what blew up the blowhole!</Text>
  <Text ID="253854">Touch-and-go, but we're back.</Text>
  <Text ID="253855">Home at last!</Text>
  <Text ID="253856">The water is a familiar green!</Text>
  <Text ID="253857">I know these winds for home!</Text>
  <Text ID="253858">A tear upon my cheek.</Text>
  <Text ID="253859">The world's oyster opens!</Text>
  <Text ID="253860">No captain could ask for more!</Text>
  <Text ID="253861">A great moment for all of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="253862">I knew this crew wouldn't let you down.</Text>
  <Text ID="253863">Success at sea is not easily won!</Text>
  <Text ID="253869">We lost everything, for greed!</Text>
  <Text ID="253870">Not even the sea can wash over our shame!</Text>
  <Text ID="253871">A rockier doom than a bosun's bottomage.</Text>
  <Text ID="253872">There's nothing more your crew couldda done.</Text>
  <Text ID="253873">You had to take us over the edge, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="255709">There be monsters abroad!</Text>
  <Text ID="255720">Wild things pursue us!</Text>
  <Text ID="255721">It's beastly, Admiral!</Text>
  <Text ID="255712">Hair-raising horrors!</Text>
  <Text ID="255722">It's no mere superstition!</Text>
  <Text ID="255723">The mark of dread upon us!</Text>
  <Text ID="255713">Fight if we must.</Text>
  <Text ID="255724">Gnash of hook and cutlass!</Text>
  <Text ID="255725">Draw yer pistols!</Text>
  <Text ID="255714">Hope yer feeling resourceful!</Text>
  <Text ID="255726">Are we masters of our craft?</Text>
  <Text ID="255727">Be not afeard of splinters!</Text>
  <Text ID="255715">Sickening!</Text>
  <Text ID="255728">Do not let us be stricken!</Text>
  <Text ID="255729">We're under the weather.</Text>
  <Text ID="255717">Prime and powder!</Text>
  <Text ID="255730">Call in the big guns!</Text>
  <Text ID="255731">A pressing engagement!</Text>
  <Text ID="255718">Be the star to steer us!</Text>
  <Text ID="255732">Set our bearings right.</Text>
  <Text ID="255733">We're adrift!</Text>
  <Text ID="255719">Uncertain shores!</Text>
  <Text ID="255734">We know not peoples as you.</Text>
  <Text ID="255735">Too cultured for us scrubbers.</Text>
  <Text ID="260021">You do have a ship, Admiral?</Text>
  <Text ID="260022">Perhaps some form of sea craft?</Text>
  <Text ID="260023">We'll need the finest ship!</Text>
  <Text ID="260024">Where is she, let me see her!</Text>
  <Text ID="260025">What have yer christened her?</Text>
  <Text ID="260026">Something to keep us going, Admiral?</Text>
  <Text ID="260027">No provisions?!</Text>
  <Text ID="260028">On biscuit alone?</Text>
  <Text ID="260029">What of supplies?</Text>
  <Text ID="260030">I'd take anything I could just now.</Text>
  <Text ID="260031">Isn't she running a little light?!</Text>
  <Text ID="260032">We'll be taking a chance, Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="260033">I don't know if she's up to this!</Text>
  <Text ID="260034">Better hope she has spirit.</Text>
  <Text ID="260035">We'll have to take your word.</Text>
  <Text ID="260036">I suppose she'll do.</Text>
  <Text ID="260037">Not the worst manifest.</Text>
  <Text ID="260038">We're adequately stocked.</Text>
  <Text ID="260039">She's set fair enough.</Text>
  <Text ID="260040">I can't make any promises.</Text>
  <Text ID="260041">Ready as she'll ever be!</Text>
  <Text ID="260042">She's an honour to command, Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="260043">Rigged to succeed.</Text>
  <Text ID="260044">She's beautifully fitted.</Text>
  <Text ID="260045">Stacked in our favour.</Text>
  <Text ID="260046">Nothing to fear.</Text>
  <Text ID="260052">High spirits.</Text>
  <Text ID="260053">Ready for anything.</Text>
  <Text ID="260054">Wind's in our sails</Text>
  <Text ID="260055">It'll be a breeze!</Text>
  <Text ID="260056">Plain sailing!</Text>
  <Text ID="260057">Seen better odds, and worse.</Text>
  <Text ID="260065">I wouldn't like to wager.</Text>
  <Text ID="260066">Stick or twist?</Text>
  <Text ID="260067">It's your call, Admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="260068">Only fate truly knows.</Text>
  <Text ID="260069">Only the wind can say.</Text>
  <Text ID="260058">How many lives have we left?</Text>
  <Text ID="260070">Put more skulls on the pile?</Text>
  <Text ID="260071">A sword hangs above us.</Text>
  <Text ID="260072">Turn about, before it's too late.</Text>
  <Text ID="260073">All I can do is to warn you.</Text>
  <Text ID="260074">If doom it must be, we will follow.</Text>
  <Text ID="260970">Too soon to head home?</Text>
  <Text ID="260971">Have we enough biscuit to last us?</Text>
  <Text ID="260972">We better let you decide, admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="260973">What are our chances?</Text>
  <Text ID="260974">Do you think we can make it?</Text>
  <Text ID="253936">This is it! Ditchwater. End of the world. I hope you like it quiet.</Text>
  <Text ID="267973">Sarmento? I know the name. Elusive.</Text>
  <Text ID="267974">The New World was discovered long ago, but few have ever found Sarmento.</Text>
  <Text ID="267970">There's no deep abyss holds intrigues as eldritch as this.</Text>
  <Text ID="254622">We shall want your best ship and crew, this will be a very challenging undertaking.</Text>
  <Text ID="254623">Last night I had a disquieting dream— I cannot allow our time to run out.</Text>
  <Text ID="264606">We cannot be too thorough in our preparations, yet we must also be swift. </Text>
  <Text ID="254624">This is our moment. Let us succeed, where the Arctic Council fails.</Text>
  <Text ID="254631">No disappointment can cause me to give up hope my husband lives.</Text>
  <Text ID="254632">You are ready to secure a foothold in the north! Find the last— most recent— encampment of my dear John's expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="254633">We have to head north before the Arctic winter takes grip!</Text>
  <Text ID="264607">We must make waves, channel my John's spirit of adventure.</Text>
  <Text ID="254634">I think you are as determined as I, to find that expedition. </Text>
  <Text ID="254635">You may have failed, but the others succeeded. That sort of togetherness is going to be vital.</Text>
  <Text ID="254639">I vow to return to the Arctic next spring, braver and stronger for our failure. </Text>
  <Text ID="264608">Because we have failed now, does not mean I shall give up hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="264609">We didn't even get close, and yet I sense they are there, all of them.</Text>
  <Text ID="254640">The Arctic Council show no sign of completing the task they have begun.</Text>
  <Text ID="264610">We will not make the same mistakes other rescuers did.</Text>
  <Text ID="264611">We have ourselves the chance to save what might otherwise be lost to the ice forever.</Text>
  <Text ID="264612">This is a matter in which I have a deep personal interest.</Text>
  <Text ID="264614">Among the many others, my dearest Sir John, is lost to the ice.</Text>
  <Text ID="264615">Signs they were there? The search may begin in earnest!</Text>
  <Text ID="264616">The Faithful Expedition shall be the success that hitherto never was.</Text>
  <Text ID="264617">We must be ready for all eventualities, this shall be no small endeavour.</Text>
  <Text ID="264618">The Inuit will know something, I intend to seek their insight at the earliest opportunity.</Text>
  <Text ID="264619">We should approach these preparations with clarity of purpose.</Text>
  <Text ID="264620">I dream of seeing us cut through the ice like a hot knife through butter! </Text>
  <Text ID="264621">I will not rest until the lost expedition are fed, bathed in hot salts and tucked up in their beds.</Text>
  <Text ID="264622">I can neglect no one supply that may prove useful in an icy wasteland.</Text>
  <Text ID="264623">We cannot underinvest in provisions and equipment.</Text>
  <Text ID="264624">We cannot rely on Inuit knowledge alone, we must have our own expertise.</Text>
  <Text ID="264625">We need the best minds to have any dream of succeeding.</Text>
  <Text ID="264626">The least I can save is my husband's reputation, if indeed he has found a northwest passage.</Text>
  <Text ID="254644">The Inuit are witness to this white expanse, they must know something of the expedition.</Text>
  <Text ID="254645">Had we listened to the Inuit sooner, the lost might already be found.</Text>
  <Text ID="264632">To ignore the wisdom of the Inuit is an arrogance we cannot afford. </Text>
  <Text ID="264633">The Arctic Council disregarded Inuit expertise and it got them nowhere! </Text>
  <Text ID="264639">I am relieved not all misunderstand the Inuit as you do.</Text>
  <Text ID="254646">Ordinary ships cannot breach the ancient ice. Build a dedicated Icebreaker before the channels thicken solid!</Text>
  <Text ID="254647">Thank providence we have an Icebreaker! We can but hope it will make us some headway. </Text>
  <Text ID="264649">Temperatures will not favour us for long.</Text>
  <Text ID="264650">The Faithful Expedition is in dire need of that Icebreaker. </Text>
  <Text ID="264651">The Arctic Council thought breaking the ice impossible too, yet someone has clearly managed it! </Text>
  <Text ID="254648">The Arctic Council's search party are in trouble, we must help them as we would anyone else.</Text>
  <Text ID="254649">We showed them anything is possible with a little belief.</Text>
  <Text ID="264655">Let us show the Arctic Council we do not give up on anyone.</Text>
  <Text ID="264656">They underestimated the power of nature, but I cannot watch them be punished for it. </Text>
  <Text ID="264657">We cannot all hope to best the elements, as the council themselves are always keen to point out.</Text>
  <Text ID="254651">We too have been humbled by the forces of nature. I hope that will not be our last chance.</Text>
  <Text ID="264678">We still have much to learn from the Inuit, if we are to succeed the next time.</Text>
  <Text ID="264679">I thought together we could do it, I hope one day I can still be proven right.</Text>
  <Text ID="264692">Coming here, I realise the frightening scale of what lies ahead of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="264693">The ice is as old as time, and more stubborn than I'd ever have believed.</Text>
  <Text ID="264694">Though it is their own expedition they abandon, the Arctic Council show no signs of contrition.</Text>
  <Text ID="264695">I am more worried than ever for the wellbeing of my husband's crew.</Text>
  <Text ID="264696">The Council's hubris coming here, expecting the unconquerable to be conquered!</Text>
  <Text ID="264697">How underprepared we are for mother nature! Only a seasonal lull gives us any hope at all. </Text>
  <Text ID="264698">My husband is a stubborn man, I only hope he was not too proud to heed the Inuit.</Text>
  <Text ID="264699">We have broken through ancient Ice, can I yet be hopeful?</Text>
  <Text ID="264700">These narrow channels will thicken solid, if we wait any longer.</Text>
  <Text ID="264701">How can they have survived in such a pitiless climate?</Text>
  <Text ID="264702">What if their provisions failed? Surely then they'd have been grateful for seals from the Inuit? </Text>
  <Text ID="264703">It was the Arctic Council who chose my dearest John, for all his flaws.</Text>
  <Text ID="264704">My husband's preparations were meticulous, I only hope he was willing to adapt.</Text>
  <Text ID="264705">What snow-monsters lie in wait, I dare not speculate.</Text>
  <Text ID="264706">We must bridge with the Inuit. Perhaps they would trade?</Text>
  <Text ID="264707">Our survival hinges on partnership with the Inuit, we must reach out to them somehow.</Text>
  <Text ID="264709">The blinding whiteness. I hope I shall be worthy of its grandeur. </Text>
  <Text ID="264710">Dinner with the admiralty, is my sum experience of the Arctic, yet now here I am.</Text>
  <Text ID="264711">Stone cairns, and signs they camped in this very spot!</Text>
  <Text ID="264712">An auspicious place for us to make camp, knowing they too were here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264713">We must set up some chain of supply here— who know how long a search will take. </Text>
  <Text ID="264714">Any provisions or equipment we can find will be beneficial to us!</Text>
  <Text ID="254654">HMS Hades and Styx came this way, if it take our last breath we must find them.</Text>
  <Text ID="254655">What does it take for a captain to abandon his ship? To go on by foot?</Text>
  <Text ID="264716">Are we too late? Is it too late for us too now? </Text>
  <Text ID="264717">We are close, I sense them; my John - all of them. </Text>
  <Text ID="264718">Follow their aura, as others have done, and we can still find them. </Text>
  <Text ID="264742">If it take our last breath we must find those walkers!</Text>
  <Text ID="264743">There is nothing more to be done now, but await the fate of the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="264744">That howling! They must long to be found!</Text>
  <Text ID="264745">We must strive onward, if it be the end of us.</Text>
  <Text ID="264746">This is the end, we must give ourselves to it fully.</Text>
  <Text ID="264773">So many sacrifices, but we have brought the survivors home! </Text>
  <Text ID="264774">That so many lives have been saved gives me hope anew. </Text>
  <Text ID="264749">We must trust the visions of the Inuit, and hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="264750">They must have been desperate to forsake the comfort of their cabins.</Text>
  <Text ID="264751">That John was not among them matters not, my belief has returned that he roams the ice yet. </Text>
  <Text ID="264752">Where are the bodies, if they are all dead? </Text>
  <Text ID="264753">Better to find skulls, than nothing at all.</Text>
  <Text ID="264754">We should dignify their memory with burial. </Text>
  <Text ID="264755">What madness caused them to forsake their equipment?</Text>
  <Text ID="264756">New life already clings to the wreckage of the old.</Text>
  <Text ID="264757">I can hear them, see their light everywhere!</Text>
  <Text ID="264758">The pole star gleams on bone.</Text>
  <Text ID="264759">The northland calls us through its open gate. </Text>
  <Text ID="264760">It's as if we are on a different plane, where souls reside.</Text>
  <Text ID="264761">The Inuit spoke of souls, I think I understand now.</Text>
  <Text ID="264762">We must hold fast, the truth will embrace us soon.</Text>
  <Text ID="267200">I reach out to all ship's captains, adventurers, luminaries, and merchant traders the length and breadth of the Empire! Heed my call! The life of many a good sailor is on the line.</Text>
  <Text ID="267201">It has been three years since the Arctic Council sent its two best ships in search of the legendary north-west passage, led by my dear husband, Sir John Faithful.</Text>
  <Text ID="267202">We've not heard from them since. The Arctic Council are sending rescue parties north, but their fleet is too thin to cover that vast territory before the arctic winter kicks in.</Text>
  <Text ID="267203">Are you decent and courageous enough to join this sole woman's cause? Worry not! Your combined efforts will be generously recompensed!</Text>
  <Text ID="267223">Can it be, the Arctic Council retreating just as we arrive? I mean the chairman is nonetheless correct, the pack ice grows stronger every day. Still, I have no intention of giving up as they have done.</Text>
  <Text ID="267224">I have assembled many of the finest-known craftsmen and ship-builders at our outpost. Presently they are preparing the shipyards to house our impressive icebreakers— vessels that will help carve a way through this frozen world.</Text>
  <Text ID="267225">I know it is a lot to ask, but will you endure and help me to create the fleet we need?</Text>
  <Text ID="267235">I had the strangest dream last evening. I saw my John floating above his quarterdeck. He was waving and shouting but could not make himself heard. The silence prevailed as I approached him, when a giant wolf appeared between us.</Text>
  <Text ID="267236">And have we gone too far also, my friend?</Text>
  <Text ID="267237">Then let us be swift and brave. If only I knew what awaited us upon this eternal expanse.</Text>
  <Text ID="267278">Finally all those sailors may rejoice with their loved ones. I know what you are thinking. But don't worry. I feel no bitterness.</Text>
  <Text ID="267280">I know the rest are alive out there, and Sir John's broad shoulders shelter them from wind and snow.</Text>
  <Text ID="267281">All the stories being shared about my husband give me the strength to return next summer, with an even bigger fleet. Can I count on you again then? I dare hope so, my friend! I dare hope.</Text>
  <Text ID="267282">Let's not beat around the bush! We found nothing but endless white, not a single soul saved.</Text>
  <Text ID="267283">And yet I know that my husband and his men are out there somewhere. Frozen cold, but alive! Still alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="267284">I will fund another rescue attempt, come back next year, better-prepared, with more ships and even-more-determined allies. Will you sail beside me again then? I dare to hope, my friend. I dare to hope!</Text>
  <Text ID="264419">Hallelujah.</Text>
  <Text ID="264420">The dream is kept alive!</Text>
  <Text ID="264421">Praise be for the certainties we have!</Text>
  <Text ID="264426">I am eternally grateful for your support.</Text>
  <Text ID="264427">You have proven all is still possible.</Text>
  <Text ID="264428">You endure where others have not.</Text>
  <Text ID="264433">We cannot allow this to stop us believing.</Text>
  <Text ID="264434">We have let a chance pass us by.</Text>
  <Text ID="264435">Now I feel the wind begin to bite.</Text>
  <Text ID="264440">Please, don't follow the Arctic Council's example.</Text>
  <Text ID="264441">Perhaps you don't realise the scale of this undertaking.</Text>
  <Text ID="264442">You don't seem as committed as the others.</Text>
  <Text ID="264447">I, Lady Faithful, knock at every door to rouse the bold and the daring.</Text>
  <Text ID="264448">You may know of my husband, Sir John Faithful whose Arctic expedition is lost and forsaken?</Text>
  <Text ID="264449">Be assured, your efforts will be suitably rewarded.</Text>
  <Text ID="264450">We must stick together if we are to endure the chill.</Text>
  <Text ID="264451">It cannot be long now before we find something.</Text>
  <Text ID="264456">The absence of a base camp might explain why the Arctic council never sustained their rescue efforts.</Text>
  <Text ID="264457">This encampment must embody hope, our one comfort in the wilderness.</Text>
  <Text ID="264460">Until the fate of any lost ship is affirmed, our efforts should not diminish.</Text>
  <Text ID="264461">Many ships from many sponsors, united by a profound desire to bring back those men alive.</Text>
  <Text ID="264464">Just when I was beginning to lose faith.</Text>
  <Text ID="264465">If we pull together like this, who knows what we can achieve.</Text>
  <Text ID="264466">We must thank the Inuit spirits who dwell here.</Text>
  <Text ID="264467">We can do it.</Text>
  <Text ID="264468">Yes, I fear we must.</Text>
  <Text ID="264469">Yes, we must set our preconceptions aside.</Text>
  <Text ID="264470">It would only make me worry.</Text>
  <Text ID="264471">Something urges me not to.</Text>
  <Text ID="264472">It's impossible.</Text>
  <Text ID="264496">I'm very grateful.</Text>
  <Text ID="264497">You are doing marvellous work.</Text>
  <Text ID="264498">Your generosity won't be forgotten.</Text>
  <Text ID="264542">We must rally together now, if we are to find them.</Text>
  <Text ID="264543">I value any help I can get, from any direction.</Text>
  <Text ID="264544">You will be rewarded, I promise.</Text>
  <Text ID="264547">Good, we all are with you.</Text>
  <Text ID="264548">Thank you.</Text>
  <Text ID="264550">They said it was impossible, you proved them wrong!</Text>
  <Text ID="264551">You have survived the elements!</Text>
  <Text ID="264555">Was the reward not substantial enough?</Text>
  <Text ID="264556">What could have led you astray?</Text>
  <Text ID="264557">Seems we've not learned from the mistakes of the past.</Text>
  <Text ID="264558">The cold has got to us.</Text>
  <Text ID="264560">The Arctic summer is only a brief window.</Text>
  <Text ID="264561">We don't have much time.</Text>
  <Text ID="264563">It does not end there, we must keep going.</Text>
  <Text ID="264564">This must be a sustained effort.</Text>
  <Text ID="264565">I know it feels like going from one pole to another.</Text>
  <Text ID="264600">You made a seal hole, now catch a seal!</Text>
  <Text ID="264569">Have you something?</Text>
  <Text ID="264570">Something to give us hope?</Text>
  <Text ID="264572">I await news of our next compass heading.</Text>
  <Text ID="264573">The matter is out of our hands for the time being.</Text>
  <Text ID="266259">Who we have here?! Samuel Goode's child. Want to go down with your father, do you!</Text>
  <Text ID="266265">You're too late. I was just a spark, and the touch-paper is already lit...</Text>

  <Text ID="266949">Yes, Grandmaster! Gladly.</Text>
  <Text ID="266210">There was a chance while yer father still lived, no use dragging it out now he's gone…</Text>
  <Text ID="266211">Bright Sands will never be matched, if that's what you're set on.</Text>
  <Text ID="266212">You are trying at least. I know Samuel wouldn't have given up.</Text>
  <Text ID="266213">I'm starting to wonder if you can't turn things around.</Text>
  <Text ID="266214">You can't bring back your father, but his spirit…</Text>
  <Text ID="266218">I don't know what you're trying to achieve here, but it won't bring Samuel back.</Text>
  <Text ID="266219">Mining for you, mining for Eli , what's the difference?</Text>
  <Text ID="266220">Your father had that same steely look.</Text>
  <Text ID="266221">It's no Bright Sands, but it really is something!</Text>
  <Text ID="266222">Your company is flourishing. You may even be the match of your father - rest his soul.</Text>
  <Text ID="266223">Samuel Goode’s engineer? Aye, that’s me. Who’s asking?</Text>
  <Text ID="266226">So I'm a commodity now, to be bought and sold? Your father treated me like a human being.</Text>
  <Text ID="266814">You're stubborn, that's for sure. A chip off the old block.</Text>
  <Text ID="266815">So you're the one that fled his duties. Well you're too late, there's nothing to be done.</Text>
  <Text ID="266816">You realise this will be no palm-tree paradise, only hard graft?</Text>
  <Text ID="266817">My wife tells me I shouldn't be so hard on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266818">You're brave coming back, many people blame this all on you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266819">Samuel always had high hopes for you. It was a great blow to him when you left.</Text>
  <Text ID="266820">My prison outfit remains in protest.</Text>
  <Text ID="266821">Edvard is the major cause of my distemper, not you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266822">Somehow got used to these pyjama stripes.</Text>
  <Text ID="266823">Dead or alive, I’ll always be Samuel’s man.</Text>
  <Text ID="266824">I realise I should have told you sooner. </Text>
  <Text ID="266825">Perhaps now you have the means to take justice into your own hands.  </Text>
  <Text ID="266826">Ah the prodigal child. Epitome of selfishness.</Text>
  <Text ID="266827">It'll take a lot to convince me you're worthy of the name Goode.</Text>
  <Text ID="266828">You never know what you have til it's gone, eh?</Text>
  <Text ID="266829">Give me a reason to forgive you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266256">I had believed it would only do harm to tell you, but I have grounds to believe your father was murdered.</Text>
  <Text ID="266257">And the killer - his cellmate - walks free! The rumour is he's in hiding, preparing to flee to the New World.</Text>
  <Text ID="266258">It is believed his accomplice supplies him with goods from the Emporium Exotique!</Text>
  <Text ID="267986">Theodora! Finally I can hold you in my arms again!</Text>
  <Text ID="266731">A shame you can't appreciate the craft this requires. Never mind, the charges have been primed, the perimeter cleared, we are ready to detonate.</Text>

  <Text ID="267148">Then Edvard struck back! He imprisoned all who were close to your father, including my beloved Thomas.</Text>
  <Text ID="267149">My husband and the others were deported to Wormways Prison and I've heard nothing from him ever since. If you do find him unharmed, prithee tell him his wife yearns for his return.</Text>

  <Text ID="265038">We are, all of us, quite moved by your selfless actions. Your father would be proud. </Text>
  <Text ID="265039">Saved! Do you also then save us from a grievous injustice…?</Text>
  <Text ID="265040">Edvard’s charges against us are pure fabrication! The man is an impostor!</Text>
  <Text ID="266766">I know we look like criminals, but we were trusted associates of your father. </Text>
  <Text ID="267221">I bring grave news from our ice pilots. The pack ice becomes too thick. We'd be risking our ships if we were to continue our rescue.</Text>
  <Text ID="267222">So with a heavy heart, I have ordered the Arctic council fleet to return southwards to our winter haven. But do not lose hope! We will gather ourselves and return next year.</Text>

  <Text ID="266475">The moral of the story is simple. Without me, it doesn’t work. See you in Anno 1305!</Text>
  <Text ID="266509">So it’s my fault again?</Text>
  <Text ID="266510">What should I be?! Say it! What is it this time? Should I hang lower in the sky? Should I turn with you? If I ever make it into the game without one person complaining I’ll eat my hat. Come on then you bright sparks, gift me an entry in the options menu, this wheelie-bin for half-finished features. Or even better! How about a day-night cycle, huh? Then every five minutes I can cede my throne to a rotten cheese!</Text>

  <Text ID="266951">Of course you are. The heat will peel your sins from your flesh like cloth. Acolytes, purge the place!</Text>
  <Text ID="266952">Pathetic! But then, surely Samuel awaits you too! The whole Goode family can be reunited in the everlasting. We squeezed the life from your father's lungs, peeled your uncle's skin...You must be curious as to what we plan for you!</Text>
  <Text ID="266953">A new world order is at stake— the Empire already shaking to its foundations, and the Goode family helpless to prevent it! We first eradicate the offspring and then eradicate the Queen!</Text>
  <Text ID="267835">First Samuel, now Edvard! Soon I will be rid of your dreary family once and for all.</Text>
  <Text ID="267848">Goode &amp; Sons. Favourites of the Royal Council. How I've enjoyed watching your family's slow and ignoble demise.</Text>
  <Text ID="267849">What a fool Edvard was to trust us!</Text>
  <Text ID="267850">Behold my solar barque!</Text>
  <Text ID="267851">Chivalry died with the monarchy! Your family of goodie-goodies was always likely to be first on my list. </Text>
  <Text ID="267852">Nothing can stop the turning of the wheel, or meek mice from crushing beneath!</Text>
  <Text ID="267853">Goode and Sons the thorn in my side. Without it, the Queen shall come quietly!</Text>
  <Text ID="267854">The Empire has no hope of survival without its vassals! </Text>
  <Text ID="267855">You will die along with your goodie-goodie father!</Text>
  <Text ID="267856">Fools! Outmaneuvered by a merchant trader!</Text>
  <Text ID="267857">Feeble underlings, you have only yourselves to blame!</Text>
  <Text ID="267858">You are not fit to kneel before the infernal mother.</Text>
  <Text ID="267859">The day has come when all the world shall rue its pride!</Text>
  <Text ID="267860">My vengeance upon you shall be my magnum opus! Just wait.</Text>
  <Text ID="267861">No! This is not the end!</Text>
  <Text ID="267862">Confound you meddling Goodes! I will return, and take you to darker places than ever you could conceive.</Text>
  <Text ID="266720">Don’t worry, that old tyrant can’t hold us back anymore!</Text>
  <Text ID="265036">We’d rather die than stay. Our flags still wave for Samuel, let Edvard oppress us no more! </Text>
  <Text ID="265037">A life away from Edvard? We're on board! Only… we've no ship to get on board of!</Text>
  <Text ID="266760">You're father always saw to it we had rights and unions and all that gubbins.</Text>
  <Text ID="266761">Shame what happened to your father. We'll stand by your side!</Text>
  <Text ID="266762">We will follow you as we followed Samuel!</Text>
  <Text ID="266763">Ready to leave Bright Sands behind!</Text>
  <Text ID="266764">If you're only half your father you're way beyond Edvard!</Text>
  <Text ID="266765">Your uncle is nothing like your father! We'll follow you!</Text>
  <Text ID="261529">Unite! Unite!</Text>
  <Text ID="261530">I feel…most unwell.</Text>
  <Text ID="261552">Should've seen her face!</Text>
  <Text ID="261551">Foetid, festering filth.</Text>
  <Text ID="261553">Fancy an ale after work?</Text>
  <Text ID="261554">It can never be replaced...</Text>
  <Text ID="261555">These daguerrotypes haven't really come out…</Text>
  <Text ID="261556">Gears completely corroded!</Text>
  <Text ID="261557">Things did seem to be moving speedily.</Text>
  <Text ID="261558">What a scam!</Text>
  <Text ID="266271">The horsemen are coming!</Text>
  <Text ID="266290">The world feels alive today.</Text>
  <Text ID="266302">Spare a coin, amigo?</Text>
  <Text ID="266305">¡Ole!</Text>
  <Text ID="261559">Hey, careful with that!</Text>
  <Text ID="261561">No slacking!</Text>
  <Text ID="261562">Fetch another cart boy, be quick.</Text>
  <Text ID="261563">A few too many weeds, but we're getting there.</Text>
  <Text ID="261564">No great shakes…</Text>
  <Text ID="261565">And it took so very long to arrive.</Text>
  <Text ID="261566">Where did you say you'd come from?</Text>
  <Text ID="261568">Rather have it with roast potatoes and a rich sauce.</Text>
  <Text ID="261567">Oh they're just adorable!</Text>
  <Text ID="261569">A portal to a lost world!</Text>
  <Text ID="261570">All I can see is a fat patina of dust.</Text>
  <Text ID="261571">Have you heard? We're at war.</Text>
  <Text ID="261572">Good tidings from the front!</Text>
  <Text ID="261573">Sound the alarum!</Text>
  <Text ID="266545">Take cover! </Text>
  <Text ID="261574">No-one leaves Wormways in a hurry.</Text>
  <Text ID="261575">I worry for our relations with the South.</Text>
  <Text ID="261576">Wi! Keep it under wraps.</Text>
  <Text ID="266376">Isabel will never surrender.</Text>
  <Text ID="266377">It's better to know if something is wrong.</Text>
  <Text ID="266230">I'm not going to tell you your father wasn't a traitor.</Text>
  <Text ID="261577">When will his children step from the shadow?</Text>
  <Text ID="266549">The tragedy! And why are we its chorus!?</Text>
  <Text ID="261578">Is it just the wind what howls at night...? </Text>
  <Text ID="268216">Ready!</Text>
  <Text ID="268217">She's small, but she's keen.</Text>
  <Text ID="268218">Falcon ready!</Text>

  <Text ID="268225">We're damaged, admiral.</Text>
  <Text ID="268226">On our way!</Text>

  <Text ID="268242">There's a bit of space in the hold.</Text>
  <Text ID="268243">This little minx will be at home in the wilds!</Text>
  <Text ID="268244">Heading out to deep seas, Admiral.</Text>

  <Text ID="268250">Back to her lovely little self.</Text>
  <Text ID="261533">Take the streets!</Text>
  <Text ID="261534">That's my boy in there!</Text>
  <Text ID="261589">Oh but surely you've seen it? Mesmerising!</Text>
  <Text ID="268222">Is it just the wind what howls at night...? </Text>
  <Text ID="261590">Can't believe he forgot his shovel!</Text>
  <Text ID="261591">It was a sumptuous spread, it really was.</Text>
  <Text ID="261592">Travel always makes one a little weary.</Text>
  <Text ID="261593">Please don't leave your crate unattended, sir.</Text>
  <Text ID="261594">I thought you were keeping tally?!</Text>
  <Text ID="261595">I really would rather return to sunlight, darling sweet.</Text>
  <Text ID="266336">It says not to touch! Gracious...</Text>
  <Text ID="266326">Is it… safe to be quite this close?</Text>
  <Text ID="261596">There's a distinct whiff of powder in the air…</Text>
  <Text ID="261597">The outlook is unremittingly bleak.</Text>
  <Text ID="261598">To arms you fools!</Text>
  <Text ID="261599">Can I have your leftover gruel? I'm wasting away!</Text>
  <Text ID="261600">Oooh! News from the palace!</Text>
  <Text ID="261601">Bon chance, mon ami!</Text>
  <Text ID="266360">Stop hogging the rum, or Annie'll hear of it!</Text>
  <Text ID="266375">It's our principles that set us apart, sister.</Text>
  <Text ID="266378">You never know if, or when they'll come for you.</Text>
  <Text ID="266231">I'd do anything to dodge Mr. Bleakworth's treadmill, but no, I'm not your expert.</Text>
  <Text ID="261602">Samuel Goode, go against a lifetime of piety?!</Text>
  <Text ID="266553">Perhaps Sir John's maps were inaccurate?</Text>
  <Text ID="266564">...rope and as many axes as you can lay hands on.</Text>
  <Text ID="261579">I've got it all over my hands now!</Text>

  <Text ID="262045">No, it is upsetting!</Text>
  <Text ID="262047">We all like a nap in the orchard…</Text>
  <Text ID="262050">How's about a little gathering indoors?</Text>
  <Text ID="262052">More in the figurative sense, if you catch my meaning?</Text>
  <Text ID="262054">I'm baffled as to how they think it a fair test.</Text>
  <Text ID="262056">One day I think I will marry.</Text>
  <Text ID="262058">Nary the decency to tip his hat.</Text>
  <Text ID="266286">We could use some rain.</Text>
  <Text ID="266292">It's so good to be en casa!</Text>
  <Text ID="266321">Madre, why can't we go outside?</Text>

  <Text ID="262077">You sunk my battleship!</Text>
  <Text ID="262079">We still have hope! And prayer.</Text>
  <Text ID="262080">Take shelter!</Text>
  <Text ID="262081">I'd do it again if I could!</Text>
  <Text ID="262082">Yes I think he'd make a good envoy, for example his Chinese is excellent.</Text>
  <Text ID="262083">Smuggling's a risky business.</Text>
  <Text ID="266349">Drink up lad.</Text>

  <Text ID="268693">Ship refurbished!</Text>
  <Text ID="268694">Good as new again!</Text>
  <Text ID="262086">I was so irate I put up posters.</Text>
  <Text ID="262088">Just as it appears in my nightmares!</Text>
  <Text ID="262089">A vivid scene if ever I saw one!</Text>
  <Text ID="262091">They do grow up fast...</Text>
  <Text ID="262093">Life's too short.</Text>
  <Text ID="262094">I had a good run…</Text>
  <Text ID="262096">I wish I had spirit to accompany you…</Text>
  <Text ID="262098">They're staging it in the open air apparently…</Text>
  <Text ID="262100">So you haven't done the required reading?</Text>
  <Text ID="262102">She's had to wear the same three dresses…</Text>
  <Text ID="262104">Really? That many carats?</Text>
  <Text ID="266285">¿Qué tal está usted?</Text>
  <Text ID="266311">¡Bienvenidos! Makes yourselves at home!</Text>
  <Text ID="266323">Nobody cleans these streets?</Text>
  <Text ID="262106">What marvels!</Text>
  <Text ID="262108">Amazing what you find down here.</Text>
  <Text ID="262110">Mother, can it really be time to leave…?</Text>
  <Text ID="262111">Must be the local custom…</Text>
  <Text ID="262112">Whose idea was it to bring grandmama?</Text>
  <Text ID="262114">Picked fresh this morning by yours truly.</Text>
  <Text ID="262116">A quasimythical beast!</Text>
  <Text ID="262118">We've paid now, we'll have to go around. </Text>
  <Text ID="262119">I want to become an archaeologist when I grow up. </Text>
  <Text ID="266334">Come on, children, it's time to go.</Text>
  <Text ID="262122">About time we gave them hell!</Text>
  <Text ID="262123">Let's raise a toast to the troops.</Text>
  <Text ID="262125">Don't worry they won't get to us. </Text>
  <Text ID="262126">Up against the wall!</Text>
  <Text ID="262127">I know, I know, article 53 is like Pandora's box.</Text>
  <Text ID="262128">You better get on Jean's good side… </Text>
  <Text ID="266348">Arrgh!</Text>
  <Text ID="266363">An idea cannot be destroyed.</Text>
  <Text ID="262129">We deserve proper explanations!</Text>
  <Text ID="266556">Who's there!? ... Mind's playing tricks on me...</Text>
  <Text ID="262131">This banner took an age to make.</Text>
  <Text ID="262132">I'm afraid this is serious…</Text>
  <Text ID="262134">Quite the spectacle!</Text>
  <Text ID="262136">Ma, please let us play in the lower field?</Text>
  <Text ID="262138">Jenny can spin herself.</Text>
  <Text ID="262140">I'll ask her this Sunday.</Text>
  <Text ID="262142">..oft delving into the unconscious…</Text>
  <Text ID="262144">It was absolutely a rat!</Text>
  <Text ID="262146">Advances in all areas of research!</Text>
  <Text ID="262148">I'm not sure if I can lend you any more.</Text>
  <Text ID="266279">El infierno…</Text>
  <Text ID="266313">We're in transition— you have to understand.</Text>
  <Text ID="262150">Ugh, what a unseemly din!</Text>
  <Text ID="262151">It's soooo exceedingly big!</Text>
  <Text ID="262152">Is the belt running faster than usual?</Text>
  <Text ID="262154">I love the smell of dew.</Text>
  <Text ID="262155">It's been so terribly nice…</Text>
  <Text ID="262156">Perhaps a little too wild…</Text>
  <Text ID="262158">Are… those mountains… moving…?</Text>
  <Text ID="262161">Where on earth could these have originated?</Text>
  <Text ID="262164">Look closer! Amazing.</Text>
  <Text ID="262166">Father, I'm bored stiff!</Text>
  <Text ID="266333">I expected them to be larger in the flesh.</Text>
  <Text ID="262167">It was a shock to see a bayonet on the dresser.</Text>
  <Text ID="262168">They're good chaps, all of them.</Text>
  <Text ID="262170">It's no longer in our hands.</Text>
  <Text ID="266543">They're at the gates!</Text>
  <Text ID="262171">I'll get my revenge in the most spectacular way.</Text>
  <Text ID="262172">This is the junior cabinet we are talking about! </Text>
  <Text ID="262173">Ahh, I miss ma mère's riz collé.</Text>
  <Text ID="266347">I'd go off the edge of the world for her.</Text>
  <Text ID="266362">We believe in Isabel.</Text>
  <Text ID="262174">The Royal Council should never have backed him publicly…</Text>
  <Text ID="266551">This way, hurry!</Text>
  <Text ID="262175">If we don't find Sir John soon… </Text>
  <Text ID="266565">If we'd gotten there just one minute later...</Text>
  <Text ID="262178">Where are the brigade?!</Text>
  <Text ID="262179">I wish I could play the trombone like that…</Text>
  <Text ID="262180">Goodbye and good riddance!</Text>
  <Text ID="262181">Can't beat a humble spud.</Text>
  <Text ID="262182">Up with the lark this morning, I was.</Text>
  <Text ID="262186">The river looks inviting...</Text>
  <Text ID="262188">The river looks inviting...</Text>
  <Text ID="262190">Nothing's ever easy.</Text>
  <Text ID="262192">We're better off investing elsewhere…</Text>
  <Text ID="262194">Here it is, taxi!</Text>
  <Text ID="266280">This is more hole than it is shoe.</Text>
  <Text ID="266284">I'd like something cold… </Text>
  <Text ID="266312">There's the good, the bad, and the ugly…</Text>
  <Text ID="266322">The dream is dying.</Text>
  <Text ID="262195">When is it expected to open?</Text>
  <Text ID="262196">The scale of it all, breathtaking!</Text>
  <Text ID="262197">Hope it's not gruel today.</Text>
  <Text ID="262199">Better doing this by hand.</Text>
  <Text ID="262201">Have we gotten lost?</Text>
  <Text ID="262202">In times like this you start to appreciate home.</Text>
  <Text ID="262206">Please may I take one home?!</Text>
  <Text ID="262209">I should say the curation is par excellence.</Text>
  <Text ID="262211">In need of restoration, it seems.</Text>
  <Text ID="266345">Perfect for a rainy afternoon.</Text>
  <Text ID="262212">I'm ready to sign up for the navy!</Text>
  <Text ID="262214">You feel one last attack may see for us.</Text>
  <Text ID="262215">What's happening, father? </Text>
  <Text ID="262217">Sacked, apparently. Certainly a high turnover…</Text>
  <Text ID="266346">And they say piracy's dying!</Text>
  <Text ID="266361">Whenever I see fire, I'm afraid.</Text>
  <Text ID="262219">Edvard is a tyrant!</Text>
  <Text ID="262220">We may not be returning ourselves… </Text>
  <Text ID="266568">I only hope we find them alive...</Text>
