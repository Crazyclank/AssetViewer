        <Name>Sea Still 1.1.1</Name>
        <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your steamer glides effortlessly through.&lt;/b&gt; The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife such as crab and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat; and indeed the crew of the ship in distress explain as you tug them into open water, it was not the algae but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.</Text>

        <Text>&lt;b&gt;The breeches buoy guarantees a safe rescue.&lt;/b&gt; The crew transform a lifebuoy into a harness, attached to runners which allow it to zip between the two ships once the harpoon rope is drawn taut. The stranded sailors take turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.</Text>

Under the encouragement of your lieutenants the other crew grab the rope, and with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Your crew's good will has shone through, the grateful survivors join your expedition without a second thought.</Text>

        <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!&lt;/b&gt; The vessel groans as it swims through the limpid waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach and sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.</Text>

        <Text>&lt;b&gt;Found them!&lt;/b&gt; Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways and comes back filled to the brim with men in overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed faces. Their captain pledges himself to your crew and, once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors and even better companions.</Text>

Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious and their captain promises to serve your crew!</Text>

The combined shots from both vessels trace the contours of the ice, breaking it with successive volleys until the floe parts and lets go under the united cheer of both crews. One of the sailors who helped shooting, taken with your crew's kindness and its brilliant skills, even offers to join it.</Text>
