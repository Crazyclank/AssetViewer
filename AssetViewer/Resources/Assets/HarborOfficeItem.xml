        <Text>&lt;b&gt;Your steamer glides effortlessly through.&lt;/b&gt; The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife such as crab and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat; and indeed the crew of the ship in distress explain as you tug them into open water, it was not the algae but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.</Text>

The stranded sailors take turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.</Text>

It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach and sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.</Text>

        <Text>&lt;b&gt;The pirates don't expect such a crafty attack.&lt;/b&gt; "I was saving these for a special occasion such as this," your weaponsmith burps. The 'special brew' he has concocted consists of a bottle filled with powder, hemp fuse, and a nail surprise. There is a shimmering sound as they explode, and when the smoke clears, your crew frisk the punctured bodies littering the deck, singing "Rollicking band of pirates, we!"</Text>

        <Text>&lt;b&gt;It is indeed an heroic charge.&lt;/b&gt; Led by the acting lieutenant, your sailors hurtle down the boarding bridges and storm the pirate ship, leaving a mangled trail in their wake. The black flag is ripped from the mast and the pirate's booty is plundered. Then your lieutenant impishly permits the survivors to go free— "Come now, be humble in thy victory! For how dull the world would be without those old pirate salts!"</Text>
